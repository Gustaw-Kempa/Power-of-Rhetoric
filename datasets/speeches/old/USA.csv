"1","Address to the Nation on the Coronavirus","
          Mar 11, 2020        ","My fellow Americans: Tonight I want to speak with you about our Nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.
 We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the Federal Government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting—and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.
 From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection.
 And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top Government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans. To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.
 There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in the South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.
 Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of redtape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus. Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other Government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly.
 The vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.
 In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.
 Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks, and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our Federal health experts, and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus: wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home.
 To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus.
 I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief. Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last 3 years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way.
 This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world. However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus.
 Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected States and Territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.
 Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief.
 Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly.
 We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a lifesaving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the well-being of America first. If we are vigilant—and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will—we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus.
 The virus will not have a chance against us.
 No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced health care, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one Nation and one family.
 As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before.
 God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-the-coronavirus"
"2","The President's News Conference","
          Mar 13, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. The President. A beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Appreciate everybody being here. Today I'd like to provide an update to the American people on several decisive new actions we're taking in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat the coronavirus. The—we've been working very hard on this. We've made tremendous progress. When you compare what we've done to other areas of the world, it's pretty incredible. A lot of that had to do with the early designation and the closing of the borders. And, as you know, Europe was just designated as the hotspot right now, and we closed that border a while ago. So that was lucky or through talent or through luck. Call it whatever you want. But through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus. I also announced Wednesday night, following the advice of our medical professionals who are doing a tremendous job—and we appreciate it very much—that we're suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days from entering the United States. Citizens, permanent residents, and our families—and even the families returning from Europe, will be subject to extra screening as well self-isolation for a period of 14 days. As the World Health Organization confirmed today, many of the things that—what we said were 100-percent correct, including our designation, before them, of Europe. Like our earlier, very aggressive actions with China, this measure will save countless lives. I appreciate a number of the folks behind me. A lot—a number of the people behind me said that that saved a lot of lives, that early designation. But it is only the beginning of what we're really doing, and now we're in a different phase. We had some very old and obsolete rules that we had to live with. It worked under certain circumstances, but not under mass circumstances. They were there for a long time; they were in place for a long time. And we're breaking them down now. And they're very usable for certain instances, but not for this. To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion of very importantly—very important and a large amount of money for States and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease. In furtherance of the order, I'm urging every State to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You're going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They're standing right behind me and to the side of me. I'm also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a very good conversation. And we're working very strongly with many States, including New York. The emergency orders I am issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital—all hospitals—and health care providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities: the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that's happened in the not-so-distant past. I tell you, what they've done with telehealth is incredible. It gives remote doctors' visits and hospital check-ins; the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services and States with the greatest need. Number two. The ability to waive requirements that critical-access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours; the ability to waive the requirements of a 3-day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home. Big thing; the authority to waive rules that hinder hospitals' ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don't have any problem getting it done. The authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself, ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We'll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever. Ten days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests. Other countries have called us and worked with us, and they're doing similar things or will be doing similar things. As a result of that action, today we're announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly, and conveniently. But we don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn't be doing it. And we don't want everyone running out and taking. Only if you have certain symptoms. Using Federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We'll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night. I want to thank Roche—great company—for their incredible work. I'd also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA's goal is to hopefully authorize their application within 24 hours—it will go very quickly; it's going very quickly—which will bring, additionally, 1.4 million tests on board next week and 5 million within a month. I doubt we'll need anywhere near that. At the same time, we've been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive- through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the—this country in large part. So the world, by the way—we're not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They've made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don't want everybody taking this test; it's totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through, and we're going to be even stronger for it. We've learned a lot. A tremendous amount has been learned. I want to thank Deborah Birx, and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what's happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I've gotten to know her very well over the last 6 days. And what we've done is rebuild something that was very old, very old- fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we're talking about. Dr. Birx, please. Thank you, Deborah. White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah L. Birx. Thank you, Mr. President. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you. White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah L. Birx.  I think you know, at the beginning of this epidemic, HHS, through CDC, proactively developed an assay built on the existing flu surveillance system. That surveillance system was then converted to diagnostic system. [Ambassador Birx continued her remarks with the aid of a flowchart titled ""Coronavirus Testing,"" concluding as follows.] Ambassador Birx continued her remarks with the aid of a flowchart titled ""Coronavirus Testing,"" concluding as follows. So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which will start in the screening website up here, facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people that have interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire, move down for symptoms or risk factors, yes. They would move down this and be told where the drive-through options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high-throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours. That is the intent of this approach. We have seen it work just in our own United States, and we want to bring this across the continent. Thank you very much. The President. Thank you very much, Deborah. Great. The President. I'd like to maybe have Tony—do you want to come up? You've become a—I think everybody out here knows you pretty well. But Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours. And you've seen a lot happen, but this has been—it's been a great experience, and working with you has been terrific. Tony, please. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is an example of—another example of what I've been referring to in my discussions with many of you in the audience as a proactive, leaning-forward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of the curve. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci. And what you're seeing now with this order is that we're going to be able to remove the constraints so that people at the State, the local level, the individual physician all the way up through the Federal Government will have as many constraints as possible removed for them to do everything they possibly can so that we can implement the things that we've been talking about—the containment, the mitigation—so that, as I've said many times, that curve that I referred to that goes up, we don't want to have that curve. We want to suppress it down to that small mound. And I think what we've done today is something that is going to be a very important element in having us be successful in doing that. We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we'll take care of that. And ultimately, as the President said, this will end. But what's going on here today is going to help it to end sooner than it would have. Thank you. The President. Thank you very much, Tony. The President. If I could, some of these folks we know; they're celebrities in their own right. They're the biggest businesspeople, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world. And one of them is Doug McMillon from Walmart. And I'd like to have Doug, if you would, say a few words, wherever you may be. Good, Doug, please. Walmart Chief Executive Officer C. Douglas McMillon. When we got the call yesterday from the White House, we were eager to do our part to help serve the country. And given what we're facing, that's certainly important to do. We should all be doing that. Walmart Chief Executive Officer C. Douglas McMillon. So we've been asked to make portions of our parking lot available in select locations in the beginning and scaling over time as supply increases so that people can experience the drive- through experience that the President described. We'll stay involved and do everything we can from a supply-chain point of view to be of assistance. Thank you, sir. The President. Thank you very much, Doug. Appreciate it very much. The President. I'll just stay right over here. And, Richard, if you could come up, please. Richard, please. Walgreens. Thank you. Walgreens President Richard Ashworth. Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. And similar to Doug and Walmart, we're happy to stand in here and help in communities all across America. Because a lot of times, when we have natural disasters, our stores are a beacon in the community, and this situation is no different. Walgreens President Richard Ashworth. So we look forward to partnering with the CDC, the administration, HHS, and the Task Force, and specifically to the Vice President, who's doing such a fantastic job. We're ready to engage and help. Thank you. The President. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Brian Cornell, Target. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Please. The President. Target Corp. Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell. Well, Mr. President, thank you for inviting us here today, along with our colleagues from Walmart and Walgreens and our partners at CVS. Normally, you'd view us as competitors, but today we're focused on a common competitor, and that's defeating the spread of the coronavirus. And we look forward to working with the administration to do our fair share to alleviate this growing threat. Target Corp. Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell. So thank you for including us today. In the near term, we're all committed to making sure we're keeping our stores open to serve the American consumer who is rapidly stocking up on household essentials, key food and beverage items that they need during this time; making sure we run safe stores; and creating an environment that's safe for our team members, making sure that they feel supported during this very critical time. So thank you for including us. The President. Thank you very much. Great job. The President. Is Tom here? Tom Polen. Tom? Tom Polen. Please. BD Chief Executive Officer and President Tom Polen. Thank you, Mr. President. As CEO of Becton Dickinson, we're one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus. We're ramping up our manufacturing capacity to ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address this issue. Thank you, Mr. President. BD Chief Executive Officer and President Tom Polen. The President. Thank you very much, Tom. Great job you've done. The President. Stephen Rusckowski, Quest Diagnostics. Please. Great job. Thank you very much. Quest Diagnostics Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President Stephen H. Rusckowski. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. So, as mentioned, we were called, with the leadership of the Vice President, last week to come together as an industry. And we took advantage of that opportunity to work with the FDA, to work with the Center for Disease Control. And we are up and running with tests in a number of our facilities. Quest Diagnostics Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President Stephen H. Rusckowski. As the President mentioned, we now have capabilities from Roche diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend. And I know myself and also my colleague at LabCorp will be doing the same, so the capacity available to the American public to support this action with consumers will be considerably increased in the next few weeks. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. The President. Mr. Rusckowki. Thanks. Mr. Rusckowki. The President. And Matt Sause, please, of Roche. Matt? Thank you, Matt. The President. Roche Diagnostics President and Chief Executive Officer for North America Matthew Sause. Thank you, Mr. President. So, from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test. We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible, because it's critical for us to make that available to help patients in need, and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States. So thank you. Roche Diagnostics President and Chief Executive Officer for North America Matthew Sause. The President. And you can do it. You can do it. Great company. David Pierre of Signify—Signify Health. Please. Thanks, David. The President. Signify Health Chief Operating Officer David Pierre. Great. Thank you, Mr. President. We are the largest house-call provider in the U.S., and we go to the homes of the most vulnerable elderly. And through our network and our logistics engine, we stand ready to help and provide our clinicians to be where they're needed, whether they're in retail clinics or in the home. And we're here to assist. Signify Health Chief Operating Officer David Pierre. Thank you very much. The President. Thank you very much. And we'll be changing a lot of the rules, regulations for future, should this happen in the future, which we hope it never does. But it will, I guess— somewhere out there. There's been some bad ones over the years, and I guess that will continue to an extent, but we hope it never happens. But we're going to be changing a lot of the old rules and specifications and regulations. The President. Adam Schechter, who has really been of tremendous help. LabCorp. Please. Adam. LabCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Adam H. Schechter. Thank you, Mr. President. At LabCorp, we're working every second of every day to increase the number of tests that we can run. We're working with academic medical centers, with our colleagues at Quest, with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure that we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward. LabCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Adam H. Schechter. And I can tell you we understand how important the testing is, and we are committed to doing everything possible. The President. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thomas Moriarty, CVS. We all know CVS. Thank you. The President. CVS Executive Vice President, Chief Policy and External Affairs Officer, and General Counsel Thomas M. Moriarty. Thank you, sir. CVS Executive Vice President, Chief Policy and External Affairs Officer, and General Counsel Thomas M. Moriarty. The President. Thank you, Thomas. The President. Mr. Moriarty. Thank you, Mr. President. We have been focused, since the start, of making sure our patients and the customers we serve have the information they need and the safety they need as well. We are committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well. And thank you, sir, for the honor. Mr. Moriarty. The President. Thank you very much. Thank you, Thomas. Thanks. Great job. The President. And Bruce Greenstein, LHC Group. Tremendously talented people. Thank you very much. LHC Group Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Bruce D. Greenstein. Mr. President, thank you for the honor of being here. And the home health industry has been treating patients and seniors in the safety and comfort of their own home for decades. We're very proud to be part of the equation for testing in their own home. For Americans that can't get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment, we're here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians, as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country. Thank you. LHC Group Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Bruce D. Greenstein. The President. Thank you very much. Fantastic. The President. [Mr. Greenstein offered the President an elbow bump.] Mr. Greenstein. Oh, we'll practice that. Mr. Greenstein offered the President an elbow bump. Mr. Greenstein.  The President. Okay, I like that. [Laughter] That's good. The President. Laughter Also announcing the following emergency executive actions today: To help our students and their families, I've waived interest on all student loans held by Federal Government agencies, and that will be until further notice. That's a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed. Based on the price of oil, I've also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. Strategic Reserve. We're going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry and making us even further toward that wonderful goal—which we've achieved, which nobody thought was possible—of energy independence. It puts us in a position that's very strong, and we're buying it at the right price. And that's something that would have not even been possible a week ago. The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up. This is a good time to fill it up. I'd like to ask Mike Pence to say a few words, please. VP. Vice President Michael R. Pence. Thank you, Mr. President. It is a—this day should be an inspiration to every American, because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-Government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we're bringing an all-of-America approach. Vice President Michael R. Pence.  [Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows. And, Mr. President, I know I join you in saying that every American should be proud of this incredible public-private partnership that's going to speeding access of testing to millions of Americans in the weeks ahead. And together, as you've said many times, together we'll get through this. Together, we'll put the health of America first. The President. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. The President. Seema. Where is Seema? I'd like you to maybe take that a step further, please, on nursing homes. Thanks. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. Thank you. Well, thank you to the President for the declaration. It allows my agency, CMS—that runs Medicare and Medicaid and has oversight of all of the Nation's health care facilities—to suspend regulations that can get in the way of treating patients during this time. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. These temporary national blanket waivers are reserved for the rarest of circumstances, and they represent a massive mobilization of our country's resources to combat this terrible virus. And the flexibilities we are offering will be a God-send to the providers, clinicians, and facilities on the frontlines of this fight. And later, CMS is going to be issuing guidance directing nursing homes to temporarily restrict all visitors and nonessential personnel, with a few exceptions such as end-of-life situations. We fully appreciate that this measure represents a severe trial for residents of nursing homes and those who love them. But we are doing what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly. Thank you. The President. Thank you very much, Seema. The President. As I said in my address to the Nation the other night, all Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus. Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself. The choice we make, the precautions we put into place are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic, which is what it is. The CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable—it's coronavirus.gov, and it's very heavily used right now, I will say—to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families, and their communities, while the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low. We've learned a lot about this over the last 2 weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well. Older Americans who are—especially, if they have a health problem, they have not done well. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease. It's incredible what's—sports—what's happening with the sporting world, where so many of the great sports that we've gotten so used to at this time of the year, they're not going to be meeting. And they've done a great service actually. But that would be another way that it could be—problems could be caused. But this is why I outlined on Wednesday night my administration's—the fact that we've issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places, but in particular, nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. We need to be consistent in adopting measures to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same, whether it's spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar no matter where you go. No matter where you go. You have some hotspots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible, and they're being very seriously affected. Key among these efforts are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adopted by many companies, universities, and schools. And we want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we've issued by CDC and these commonsense measures. A lot of it is common sense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gatherings, postpone assemblies, social functions, and sporting events; stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren't canceled; limit in-person meetings; increase scheduled cleanings; and cancel work-sponsored travel—among numerous other steps that can be taken. Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth, and in the coming weeks, we will all have to make changes and sacrifices, but these short-term sacrifices will produce long- term gain. And again, I've said we're learning a lot for the future and future problems like this, or worse. Or worse. It could get worse. The next 8 weeks are critical. We can learn—and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. In—interesting terms and very accurate. I think you're going to find in a number of weeks it's going to be a very accurate term. In times of hardship, the true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people, and we will get through this all together. We will just get through it. So much progress has already been made. And frankly, the numbers—because of steps that have been taken—are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places with far smaller populations. The spirit and the will of our Nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion. And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource, and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people. So we're with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis. As you know, we are rated number one in the world. We're also helping other nations—many other nations; we're helping them a lot. And they're doing okay, in some cases. In some cases, they're not doing well at all. But we're working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations. With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed. We will prevail. We will be very, very successful. And we'll learn for the future. Thank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Please. John Roberts, Fox News Q. Mr. President, how are you doing, sir? Q. The President. And if you'd like to ask some of the folks up here, it would be fine. Please. The President. House of Representatives Economic Stimulus Package House of Representatives Economic Stimulus Package Q. Sure. Mr. President, where are you with the House bill? Yesterday we talked to you in the Oval Office; you were opposed to it. What has happened since then? And what's the holdup on that? Q. The President. Well, we just don't think they're giving enough. We don't think the Democrats are giving enough. We're negotiating. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden, they didn't agree to certain things that they agreed to. So we could have something, but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country. The President. Q. And if I could ask Dr. Fauci—— Q. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. Go ahead, please. The President. National Economy/Strengthening Efforts National Economy/Strengthening Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You just mentioned waiving interest for student loans. Q. The President. Yes. The President. Q. You talked about buying oil from the—from the SPR, or adding to the SPR. What other specific targeted measures is your administration thinking about taking? The Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said today that you're just in the ""second inning"" of things that you might be undergoing. Q. The President. Yes, well, that's true. And we are looking at many different things, as you know. You know some of them—they've been written about very widely. But we're going to be releasing a paper in about 2 hours stating quite a few other steps, very important ones. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Please, go ahead. Q. Q. Like what, sir, if you wouldn't mind? Q. The President. Please, go ahead. The President. President Jair Messias Bolsonaro of Brazil President Jair Messias Bolsonaro of Brazil Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I want to know if you are in contact with the Brazilian President, Bolsonaro, after a member of his delegation who was with you Saturday was tested positive. Q. And also Senators—I want to ask another question, if you'll let me. Senators Lindsey Graham and also Senator Scott—Rick Scott—are self-isolating. Are you planning to take any kind of precautionary measure to protect you and also your staff who was there with him? The President. No, we have no symptoms whatsoever. And we have—we had a great meeting with the President of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy. Very—a very tremendous—he's done—he's doing a fantastic job for Brazil. The President. And, as you know, he tested negative—meaning, nothing wrong—this morning. And we got that word too. Because we did have dinner with him; we were sitting next to each other for a long period of time. Q. But are you in contact with him over the coronavirus crisis? Q. The President. No, we got—we have. We're talking about it, country to country, but we did discuss if he had a problem. It was reported that he may have it, and he doesn't, fortunately. The President. Yes. Coronavirus Testing Opportunities/Public Health Testing Protocols Coronavirus Testing Opportunities/Public Health Testing Protocols Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, ""a failing."" Do you take responsibility for that? And when can you guarantee that every single American who needs a test will be able to have a test? What's the date of that? Q. The President. Yes, no, I don't take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we're talking about. And what we've done is redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behind me. And we're now in very, very strong shape. The President. I think we'll be announcing, as I said, Sunday night, and this will start very quickly. And we'll have the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time. So no. And what we have done—and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future, in case something like this happens again. But it was a—and that's not the fault of anybody. And frankly, the old system worked very well for smaller numbers—much smaller numbers—but not for these kind of numbers. Tony, maybe you'd like to say something? Q. By Sunday night, will you have—— Q. The President. Tony, please. The President. Q. Yes, please. By Sunday night, will every American be able to get a test? Q. Director Fauci. So, just to reiterate what I said to many of you multiple times: It's— [inaudible]—of a system. This system was not designed—for what it was designed for, it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. Director Fauci. inaudible If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you're seeing, because you can't do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now, looking forward, the system will take care of it. Q. And, Mr. President, with respect, you've been—— Q. The President. And interestingly, if you go back—please—if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn't do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn't do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late. The President. What we've done—and one of the reasons I think people are respecting what we've done: We've done it very early. We've gotten it very early. And we've also kept a lot of people out. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Yes, please. Go ahead. Please. The President. Q. Mr. President, the last administration said that they had tested a million people at this point. You've been—— Q. The President. Well, ask them how they—— The President. Q. ——President for 3 years. Q. The President. ——did with the swine flu. It was a disaster. The President. Q. But, with respect, you've been President for 3 years—— Q. The President. Next, please. Next, please. The President. Q. ——and Wuhan was suffering—— Q. The President. They had a very big failure with swine flu. A very big failure. The President. Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask you about the European travel ban that goes into effect at—— Q. The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——midnight tonight and the exemption that you've offered to the U.K. There are 17 countries that are in the so-called Schengen zone that have fewer coronavirus cases than the U.K. And just in the past 24 hours, the U.K. has added 208 coronavirus cases to their total. Why do they, Mr. President, deserve an exemption? And would you consider adding them to this travel ban list? Q. The President. Well, that was recommended to me by a group of professionals, and we are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out. And we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will, you could say, ban—or whatever—it is during this period of time. The President. But yes, their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours, so we may be adding that, and we may be adding a couple of others. And we may, frankly, start thinking about taking some off. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Go ahead. The President. Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm a correspondent with Hong Kong Phoenix TV. You have been mentioned—you have mentioned that the number in China has been decreasing and China has made tremendous progress in the past 2 weeks. Q. The President. It's true. The President. Q. I'm wondering how much confidence does this give you to control the virus in the United States. And do you see the data China has been sharing with the United States has been helpful? Q. The President. I think it has been helpful. We've been working very much with China. I've spoken, as you know, with President Xi. They went through hell, and their numbers are starting to look very good. They're really looking very good. We're very happy about that. We are sharing data, yes. In fact, we're sharing quite a bit of data, including the fact that some of our pharmaceutical companies are working over there right now with large groups of people. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Yes, go ahead. Please. The President. Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada/Canada-U.S. Trade Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada/Canada-U.S. Trade Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau yesterday. Q. The President. Yes, I did. The President. Q. Did you discuss the potential closing of the border between Canada and the U.S.? And, by extension, are you considering ways to salvage the $2 billion daily trade between the two countries? Q. The President. So we didn't discuss the border. We've had a very good relationship. Just about finished with the USMCA, as you know. He called—actually, he called me to tell me that. I think that was the primary reason for the call. The President. At the time, his wife had not been diagnosed. And she's a lovely lady, wonderful lady, great lady. And since then, I've heard—read—that the result was that she has it. And I was a little surprised. I think he was surprised also. We did discuss it prior to. She's going to be fine, but he thought that she would not, most likely, have the virus. Unfortunately, she does. But we didn't discuss the border yesterday, no. Go ahead, please. If you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should—even a business question related to what we're talking about. Coronavirus Testing and Screening/National Economy/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S. Coronavirus Testing and Screening/National Economy/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S. Q. Mr. President, Ross Palombo from ABC News Miami. As a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry that Florida depends upon? And since Senator Rick Scott and Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Giménez have the same exposure as you, and they are self-isolating, what's your message to them, that they shouldn't be? Q. The President. Well, I don't know that I had exposure, but I don't have any of the symptoms. The President. And we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, ""You don't have any symptoms whatsoever."" And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant. As far as the cruise line business, we're with them all the way. It's a great business. It's a great U.S. business, frankly. And I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business, obviously, was hit very hard. We had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it. Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K. We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people; U.K., likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom. And we have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really—you don't hear about it anymore. It worked out really well. Mike, you may even want to say something about that because that was really done properly. Vice President Pence. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And that program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards, orderly way, as the President directed. And Americans that needed treatment have received them. Vice President Pence. [Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows. And what the President has directed us to do is, whether there is a pause in the moment, as some cruise lines are doing, and as we all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this, that cruise lines and the medical services that are available, and for the passengers and all of the crew, that cruise lines are safer than ever before and can prosper for many years to come. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Go ahead, please. The President. Coronavirus Containment Efforts Coronavirus Containment Efforts Q. This question is for Drs. Fauci and Birx. Dr. Fauci, based on what you currently know, what is the trajectory for when this outbreak will peak? How long will the American people have to remain on this emergency footing? Q. And for Dr. Birx, as the administration tries to get its arms around this test kit shortage issue, the next glaring need could be respirators and related hospital equipment. So what is the administration doing right now to ramp up production of respirators and that kind of equipment should this outbreak persist? Director Fauci. Okay. So when you have an outbreak like this, particularly if you're trying to interfere with it, it's really impossible to predict the time element of when it's going to peak and when it's naturally going to go down. Director Fauci. [Director Fauci continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] The success of that and how much you make this——[Director Fauci indicated a steep curve with a sweep of his hand.]——turn into this——[Director Fauci indicated a shallow curve.]——is going to give you the amount of time. If we're successful, it will be less. If we're not successful, it's going to be more. But these kind of things generally run out in a few months. Director Fauci continued his remarks, concluding as follows. Director Fauci indicated a steep curve with a sweep of his hand. Director Fauci indicated a shallow curve. Hopefully, we'll make it several weeks—8, 9, whatever weeks. But I can't give you a number, because it depends on how successful we are. Ambassador Birx. Great, thank you. It's a great question, and Dr. Fauci and I have worked together a very long time and continue. It's a privilege to work with him every day. Ambassador Birx. [Ambassador Birx continued her remarks, concluding as follows.] Ambassador Birx continued her remarks, concluding as follows. And the hospital emergency preparedness plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we're in full planning mode for each of those things. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. And I might add that we're in the process—and, in some cases, have already done it—ordered a large number of respirators, just in case. We hope we don't need them, but we've ordered a large number. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Yes. Go ahead, please. Q. Global Coronavirus Outbreak/Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Global Coronavirus Outbreak/Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. In your speech to the Nation, you mentioned the situation in China and South Korea have improved, and you're thinking about remove the restrictions, also the warning—— Q. The President. Right. The President. Q. ——in place right now. When can we expect that announcement? And how do you see the overall progress that Asian countries made? Q. The President. Well, some are making progress; some are not, as you know. But some are making progress. And as they make progress, as they get down to the number that we all think is right—that they know is right, we know is right—we'll be opening it up. And some are really moving along rapidly. We hope to be able to open things up as quickly as possible. The President. Go ahead, please. Go ahead. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask Secretary Azar and Dr. Fauzi just how—— Q. The President. That was good. [Laughter] The President. Laughter Q. Dr. Fauci. Okay? Q. The President. Right. Better. The President. Q. All right. Q. The President. Better. Not 100 percent, but 90 percent. The President. Q. Right. Q. The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. This affects the elderly, primarily. And in that sense, it's an unusual disease. Is any specific research being done as to why it affects our senior citizens more than others? Q. Director Fauci. So I don't mean to diminish your question, but we already know why it would affect senior citizens more, because when you talk about anything that requires a robust immune system, as you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young. And that's the reason why, when you talk about even influenza, which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades, the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Director Fauci. The same thing holds true for a variety of other disease. Why cancer is more prevalent in some—in mostly in older individuals—because the immune system that screens for it is less robust. So it really is something that is kind of well known over a lot of studies. The President. Okay. OAN, please. OAN. The President. China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China Q. Mr. President, the Chinese officials are expressing some tones of discontent with how— where the source of this virus has come from, and they're spinning some odd narratives. What are your response to the Chinese officials who are doing that? And have they signaled any kind of resistance to upcoming trade talks in response to how we're handling this virus? Q. The President. No, we have our deal with China. They're going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and $50 billion from our farmers. And that's a great deal for our country; it's about time somebody did that. And frankly, phase two, we'll start negotiating. The President. I did read one article, but I don't think that article was representative, certainly not of my conversations with President Xi. And they know where it came from. We all know where it came from. Federal Coronavirus Response/Domestic Containment Efforts Federal Coronavirus Response/Domestic Containment Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yamiche Alcindor from PBS NewsHour. Q. The President. Yes. The President. Q. My first question is: You said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic office, and the officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly. So what responsibility do you take to that? And the officials that worked in that office said that you—that the White House lost valuable time because that office was disbanded. What do you make of that? Q. The President. Well, I just think it's a nasty question, because what we've done is—and Tony has said numerous times that we've saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. And when you say ""me,"" I didn't do it. We have a group of people I could—— The President. Q. It's your administration. Q. The President. I could ask perhaps—my administration—but I could perhaps ask Tony about that, because I don't know anything about it. I mean, you say—you say we did that. I don't know anything about it. The President. Q. You don't know about the—— Q. The President. We're spending—I don't know. It's the—— The President. Q. ——reorganization that happened at the National Security Council? Q. The President. It's the—it's the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen. The President. Q. But this was a—— Q. The President. Okay. Please go ahead. The President. Q. This was an organization at the National Security Council. Q. The President. We're doing a great job. Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and the—these great, incredible doctors and business people—the best in the world. And I can say that. Whether it's retailers or labs, or anything you want to say, these are the best of the world. We're doing a great job. The President. We have 40 people right now. Forty. Compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount. And one of the reasons we have 40 and others have—and, again, that number is going up, just so you understand. And a number of cases, which are very small, relatively speaking—it's going up. But we've done a great job because we acted quickly. We acted early. And there's nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders to highly infected areas. Please, go ahead. Global Coronavirus Outbreak/Domestic Containment Efforts/Coronavirus Outbreak in Italy/Multilateral Cooperation Efforts Global Coronavirus Outbreak/Domestic Containment Efforts/Coronavirus Outbreak in Italy/Multilateral Cooperation Efforts Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Vanessa Jaklitsch for NTN24 for Latin America countries—— Q. The President. Yes, sure. The President. Q. ——and also for Spain, La Razón and Antena 3. I would like to ask you two very brief questions. One: For how long we're going to have the emergency—I mean, the national emergency? And—— Q. The President. I hope not long, but it's there now and it gives tremendous powers for things that we need. Tremendous power, actually. And the Stafford Act and various other things that we're involved with and have studied and memorized in so many different ways and forms, it gives the kind of power that we need to get rid of this virus. The President. And we're going to do it very quickly. And I hope we won't need it very long, but whatever it takes. Q. So, for now, we still don't know for how long? And I—something very important I wanted to ask you is, like, how do you think—do you really think it's essential coordinating with other countries and learning from the lessons that—they already suffer the same situation— countries—— Q. The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——of course, like China and South Korea, but now, recently—— Q. The President. Sure. The President. Q. ——Italy and Spain. And how—— Q. The President. Well, Italy is having a—— The President. Q. ——is that coordination done? Thank you so much, Mr. President. Q. The President. Italy is having a very—yes—we're in touch with Italy and, you know, it's a— it's a country that we love. We have tremendous—millions and millions of people, originally— origins from Italy. And we're working with them. They're in a very—they're in, probably, relatively speaking, the toughest position of all. The President. We're in touch with everybody. We're in touch with—when I say ""everybody,"" we're in touch with many of the countries that you know about, that you're writing about. And they're calling us asking for advice. They're asking for the advice of the people behind me. Italy has got a tough situation, but they're really—they have really clamped down, and I think they're going to see some very good results. It's tough. What they did—they really took their medicine, but they're going to see some much better results. Yes, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. Jeff Mason, Reuters Brazilian Press Secretary Fabio Wajngarten/Potential Domestic Travel Restrictions Brazilian Press Secretary Fabio Wajngarten/Potential Domestic Travel Restrictions Q. Thank you, sir. With regard to domestic travel: Should Americans feel safe or should Americans at all be traveling to states such as Washington State, New York, and other hotspots within this country? Q. And a follow-up on Brazil: You're asking people who come back from America—from Europe—Americans who are coming back from Europe to self-quarantine for a couple weeks. You were in a picture with somebody who now has coronavirus from Brazil, at Mar-a-Lago. How is that different? The President. Well, I'll tell you, first of all, I'm not coming back from someplace. The President. Q. But you were exposed. Q. The President. We—and there was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures, and it lasts for, literally, seconds. I don't know the gentleman that we're talking about. I have no idea who he is. I haven't seen the picture. I said, ""There's a picture of somebody,"" but I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day. And that night I was taking hundreds of pictures. So I just don't know. The President. Now I did sit with the President for probably 2 hours, but he has tested negative. So that's good. Q. It's just a matter of—— Q. The President. Please, go ahead. The President. Q. And the domestic travel, sir? Q. The President. Go ahead, please. The President. Q. The travel? The first part of the question was domestic travel. Q. The President. I would say, if you stay home, it's not bad. It's not bad. Now, there are certain parts of the country that are—essentially, you have no—have zero problem. Washington has been very tough—in particular, a nursing home. And, but Washington—the State of Washington has been very tough. It's been a big percentage of—when you talk about the 40 deaths, that's been has been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well. And they all came from a very certain area, unfortunately. The President. Please, go ahead. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Go ahead. Okay. The President. Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Q. The President. Yes. The President. Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S. Q. Cordelia Lynch, Sky News. You talked this week about the U.K. doing a good job in tackling coronavirus. In light of the rising cases, are you changing your mind about that? You also just spoke about possible travel restrictions. Have you discussed when they might be put in place? Q. The President. Well, in light of the results, as we discussed before—in light of the results, we're going to be looking at it. And I know the Task Force is looking at it very strongly—Vice The President. President, everybody. I mean, it was looking good, but they've—the results have been building up pretty rapidly. So we'll be taking another look at that. Yes, absolutely. Go ahead, please. Coronavirus Testing Protocols/The President's Personal Precautions Coronavirus Testing Protocols/The President's Personal Precautions Q. Mr. President, thank you. I want to first follow up on Jeff's question, because the person you were standing next to, whether you know who he is or not, tested positive for coronavirus. Dr. Fauci said this morning, ""If you stand next to somebody who tested positive, you should self- isolate and get a test."" You say your White House doctor is telling you something different. Who should Americans listen to? Q. And my second question is—— The President. I think they have to listen to their doctors, and I think they shouldn't be jumping to get the test unless it's necessary. But I think they have to listen to their doctors. And I mean, I don't know the—I haven't seen the picture. Somebody said there's a picture with somebody taking a picture with me, but I haven't seen it. But I can tell you—— The President. Q. Well, doctors have said you might have it even if you don't have symptoms. Q. The President. Well—— The President. Q. Are you being selfish by not getting tested and potentially exposing—— Q. The President. Well, I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested. The President. Q. Are you going to be? Q. The President. Most likely, yes. Most likely. The President. Q. When do you think that will happen? Q. The President. Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it any way. Fairly soon. The President. Q. Will you let us know the results? Q. The President. We're working on that. We're working out a schedule. The President. Q. My second question, Mr. President—— Q. The President. You go ahead, please. The President. Q. That was a follow-up. Q. The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. Yes. The President. Coronavirus Testing Protocols Coronavirus Testing Protocols Q. I know there's been a lot of talk about testing. I just want to make sure we're clear though, because we've been hearing from doctors who say, as of today, they still can't get patients tested who need a test. So, as of today, can everyone who a doctor wants to have tested get tested? And if not, when? When will doctors—— Q. The President. Well, that's been true for a while. But I'll let Mike—why don't you answer that, Mike, please? The President. Vice President Pence. Well, as the President said and Dr. Fauci has articulated, the nature of our current system—where the CDC has sample sent and tests are performed or state labs perform tests or, in some cases, university and hospital labs perform tests—is generally adequate for an infectious disease or for people getting diagnostic work done. But given the sheer scale of this, the President tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and private partnership. Vice President Pence. [Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Vice President Pence continued his remarks, concluding as follows. Now, anyone in consultation with their physician, regardless of their symptoms can request a test and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their State. But very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites and be able to obtain and participate in a test. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible Vice President Pence. Dr. Birx, is there more to amplify that? Vice President Pence. Ambassador Birx. No, I think that's perfectly said. I think, just to review once—more time about the testing: With LabCorp and Quest—I think many of you have been to a doctor's office and seen the little boxes outside—what they do is, they deliver both the specimen collection piece—because, remember, it's a nasal swab; it's not a tube of blood. So they've delivered that to doctors' offices and hospitals, and then they will arrange to pick that up. Ambassador Birx. The important piece in this all is, they've gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput, to the potential to have automated extraction. I know you don't want all these details, but it's really key for the laboratory people. It's an automated extraction of the RNA that then runs in an automated way on the machine, with no one touching it, and the result comes out at the other end. So sample to machine to results. That cuts out a lot of the manual pieces that were happening that were delaying the test results. Q. And so, with that, what's the timeline like from when you're tested to when you get results? Like, next week, what should people expect? Q. Ambassador Birx. Well, with the prior testing, it was taking several days because the test is slower. We believe with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start— remember, it has to transport—to the laboratory that will run it. And then, we're hoping that all can be finished within 24 hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receive today. Ambassador Birx. These are not point-of-care tests. We are working on point-of-care tests, but we have to realize point-of-care tests take 6 months or more to develop. So we're not waiting for those. We're still diagnosing this on nucleic acid, so as an antibody. This is actually the antigen—the actual virus in your nose that we're amplifying. The President. I think you have to remember though: We're working very closely with States, and there you have a smaller form and more targeted form of government going in and doing it—like, in New York, where the relationship is very good; like Gavin Newsom, where he made some very complimentary because—that's California—he made some really complimentary comments the other day about how we're working together. We worked on the ship together, but we worked on a lot of other things together, having to do with this. The President. And we're—well, really, the relationship that we have—I can't think of a bad relationship. We're helping them. We're funding them, in some cases, depending on what it is you're talking about. And we're all working together very closely. So we've done, really, I think a tremendous job of teamwork with the different States. All right. One or two more. And if you have questions for these folks—does anybody have a question for the folks up here? Who has a question up here? You have? Okay, go ahead. If you have a question, go ahead. National Economy/Economic Sectors Impacted by the Coronavirus Pandemic National Economy/Economic Sectors Impacted by the Coronavirus Pandemic Q. Thank you. I have one for you as well. Q. The President. Okay. I thought—I knew you would. The President. Q. [Laughter] No, but I do have one for them, because I haven't heard this yet. Q. Laughter The President. I was waiting for that. Go ahead. The President. Q. Because I haven't heard this yet. Q. The President. Ask them first, please. The President. Q. Yes, I will. Okay. With regards to the CEOs, can you please tell us when you expect to see items like hand sanitizer that have been going out of stock very quickly back on the shelves? There have been a lot of reports about that. Q. And, for you, Mr. President, could you talk about a potential bailout for the cruise industry? You had suggested that could happen. Is that something you're still looking at? And how much would that be? The President. Well, I didn't suggest that it could happen, but I can tell you it's an industry that was very badly impacted by what's going on with the virus. And it's a great industry. It's a very important industry, and we will be helping them. And we will be helping the airline industry, if we have to—assuming we have to. The President. So far, people haven't been asking. But if they should be asking, we'll—we want to make sure our airlines are very strong. And then, one day—and one day, all of a sudden, it wasn't looking so good. Interestingly, we were just talking—I was talking to Doug, and the numbers they're doing from the retailing standpoint—I guess, because of this, your business is like the opposite. All of you have done—you've been selling a lot of stuff. Do you want to answer the question, as to the hand sanitizers? Mr. McMillon. Sure. Yes, specifically the areas where we're seeing pressure in the supply chain are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, paper goods, in particular. Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have a hundred percent in stock on for some time. We're still replenishing it and shipping it, but as soon as it hits the stores, it's going. The same thing is true for the categories I just mentioned. So all of the retailers will be working hand in hand with the suppliers to bring that to the market as fast as we can. Mr. McMillon. Q. What is your advice though for Americans who are seeking those items? What is your advice? They're selling out online. They're selling out in the stores. What—— Q. Mr. McMillon. I think this team has given you other examples of what people can do to fight back against this virus, and you should look at the entire list. Mr. McMillon. Vice President Pence. Wash your hands with soap. Dr. Fauci can speak to that. It'd be good. Vice President Pence. The President. Please. The President. Director Fauci. I mean, obviously, it sounds very simplistic, but wash your hands as often as you possibly can. And I know you're not always in a position to be able to wash your hands, but wash them as much as you can. If you don't have the alcohol wipes, try and get them. If you can't get them, just try as best as possible to do it. I mean you got to do the best you can. Director Fauci.  The President. Alex, please. The President. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. Well, just general preparedness. You know, you want to wash your hands. You want to keep distance from people. And if you're around someone sick, keep away from them. This is basic, basic public health. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. No, these guys are selling a lot of toilet paper. I don't know, there seems—[laughter]—Tony, do you need to give some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection against getting the coronavirus? [Laughter] They're selling out. But the—soap and water. Hot water, soap, 20 seconds. That's how you do it. laughter Laughter The President. Okay. One more. Go ahead. Go ahead. No. Over here. Behind you. Behind you. The President. Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You have a great team, of course. Q. The President. That's true. Thank you. The President. National Economy/The President's Recent Travel to India/China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Vaccine Development National Economy/The President's Recent Travel to India/China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Vaccine Development Q. My question is to Mr. President: Are you happy from the Chinese response? What correctly really told you, what really happened those days? Q. And second, Prime Minister Modi, or India, have closed borders until April 15. If you have spoken with the Prime Minister of India, and if they have needed any help? And finally, sir, any message for the small businesses? Because they are losing some businesses because of this. Thank you, sir. The President. Well, on small businesses, the Small Business Administration is now stacked with money to help them, and we're going to make the money readily available if they need it— small businesses. The President. We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days, and he's a great friend of mine. And he's a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly, as was I, in that stadium; that was an incredible event. And I loved being with him, so just say hello to him. But we—we talked about everything. We talked about far more than just borders. And as far as President Xi—likewise, he's a friend of mine. I believe that we are dealing in good faith. And we just worked to, as you know, and as I just said—we just worked an incredible deal. A big deal. One of the biggest deals ever made of any kind. Big even by the standards of some of the people here—the deal with China. But I think that they want to get to the bottom of things also. We're working—our drug companies, our pharmaceutical companies are working very closely with China and with India, as you know, and with—all over the world. And they're all over the world. These are magnificent companies that are very, very knowledgeable. And it's—we're very lucky to have them, because I think you're going to come up with— whether it's therapeutic or whether it's just help—helping getting better. And then, ultimately, a vaccine, which takes a little bit longer because of the test periods and a couple of other reasons. You're going to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge. And they'll have it very quickly. They've made a tremendous amount of progress. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Q. Why didn't the cases go down to zero? Mr. President, you said that cases would go to zero. Can you explain why that didn't happen? Q.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1239"
"3","The President's News Conference","
          Apr 14, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Please. Very importantly, I'd like to begin by saying that we've just reached agreement—the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines—to participate in a payroll support program. This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy, and protect taxpayers. Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them. The President. The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light. We see that tunnel. And at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We're starting to see it. More than ever before, we've held our rate, the numbers, the—everything we've done. We've been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it. You look at what's happening in other countries—Spain, Italy, United Kingdom—we're working with them. We're trying to help them, especially with ventilators. They've been calling a lot. They need ventilators so badly. Fifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases. Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, ""Wow, that looks bad."" But they don't have the problem. I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing—even you people. It's so different looking out there when I look at you. Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives. And today I'm instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what's going on there. American taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less. As the organization's leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability. One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died. Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved. Instead, look at the rest of the world. Look at parts of Europe. Other nations and regions, who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. Many countries said, ""We're going to listen to the WHO,"" and they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe. Nobody can believe. The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures. Travel bans work for the same reason that quarantines work. Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission. Border control is fundamental to virus control. Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises. With the outbreak of the COVID–19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible. The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain that and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it's not, to independently to tell the world the truth about what is happening. The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable. It's time, after all of these decades. The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese Government's official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately. Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary. The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time. More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts in to examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done. The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples, to this date, has deprived the scientific community of essential data. New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports. And the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality. The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors and on new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID–19 in the country of origin is deeply concerning, especially when we put up, by far, the largest amount of money. Not even close. Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death—very little death—and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese Government, even praising China for its so- called transparency. I don't think so. The WHO pushed China's misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans. They told us, when we put on our travel ban—a very strong travel ban—there was no need to do it. ""Don't do it."" They actually fought us. The WHO's reliance on China's disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that. The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions. If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals. We'll have no choice but to do that. Our countries are now experiencing—you look all over the world—tremendous death and economic devastation because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so. It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes. We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups, medically, politically, and every other way. And we'll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners: what do we do with all of that money that goes to WHO. And maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won't. But we'll be able to see. As you know, in other countries hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators. But due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our health care workers, and the resilience of our health care system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator—with all of the talk you've heard, where some States wanted 40,000 ventilators. I said, ""That doesn't work,"" 40,000. And they ended up with 7- or 8,000, and they had no problem. Forty thousand ventilators for one State. It was ridiculous. The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited. I had Governors requesting unreasonable sums that the Federal Government just didn't have. And you look at the States. The States didn't have—the States were not prepared. I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn't get one would die. And that's what we were told: They would die. I saw another country's doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn't. And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis. Those that didn't get ventilators were said to be in a position only of one alternative, and that was death. Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn't get them ventilators and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately? I instructed my team to move Heaven and Earth to make sure that this didn't happen. We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had. And I got daily updates on the supply we had from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates. We had a great group of people working on it. I instructed my team to use the Defense Production Act. And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully—more powerfully than anybody would know. In fact, so powerfully that, for the most part, we didn't have to officially take it out—it was a hammer; it was a very powerful hammer—in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible. Last year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators. It could be as high as 200,000, far more than we'll ever need. So we'll be able to stockpile. We'll be able to talk to States about stockpiling. These are high-quality ventilators. We had a choice: We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high-quality. We've done a high-quality ventilator. So we should have anywhere from 150- to 200,000 ventilators. In addition to that, we have 10,000 ventilators right now in the Federal stockpile ready to move should we need them—we might not—should we need them in New York or New Jersey or in Louisiana or in Illinois or any other State that may need them if we have a surge. I'd like to ask Adam Boehler to come up and just say a few words. He's done a fantastic job, a young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation. And I'd just like to have— have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words. Adam, please. Thank you very much. U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Adam S. Boehler. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible. Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June. U.S. International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Adam S. Boehler. [Mr. Boehler continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Mr. Boehler continued his remarks, concluding as follows. These have been difficult times. A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office, and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies. We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President. This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans. Thank you. The President. Thank you very much. Fantastic job. The President.  Mr. Boehler. Thank you, sir. Mr. Boehler.  The President. I'd shake his hand, but I'm not allowed to. Times have changed, haven't they? The President.  Thank you very much. You did a fantastic job. We're very proud of you—you and your whole team. Thank you. Today we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available ventilators. This afternoon I met with the leaders—the top people—of many of America's big, powerful, beautiful, and you know, very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today. We had a great meeting, learned a lot. And they've been going through a lot and they've been doing a fantastic job, as everybody here will attest. I'm pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve so that we're going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we're able to help our States with at a later date if there's ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again. It was 1917, 1918. That's a long time ago. We hope it never happens again. And I'd like to ask Rick Pollack, CEO of American Hospital Association; Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare—that's the largest in the United States; Warner Thomas, CEO of Ochsner Health. And if I could, Mihal—you—are you here from Cleveland Clinic? Somebody? Good. Thank you. Come on up, folks. Please. Thank you. Say a few words please. American Hospital Association Chief Executive Officer and President Richard J. Pollack. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need. American Hospital Association Chief Executive Officer and President Richard J. Pollack. [Mr. Pollack continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Mr. Pollack continued his remarks, concluding as follows. We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We'll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership, and we look forward to working with you in making this a success. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you very much. The President.  HCA Management Services, L.P., Chief Executive Officer Samuel N. Hazen. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you, in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country. HCA Management Services, L.P., Chief Executive Officer Samuel N. Hazen. One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID–19 battle was to find partnerships: partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and Federal. And we're proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership, and I think it's going to do great good for the community. So thank you very much. The President. Great job. Thank you. The President.  Ochsner Health Chief Executive Officer and President Warren L. Thomas. Thank you, Mr. President. It's great to have Ochsner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient, and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient, of help getting ventilators to our State and to Ochsner Health. Ochsner Health Chief Executive Officer and President Warren L. Thomas. We're currently taking care of about 60 percent of the COVID patients in New Orleans, and we did see a spike over the past few weeks. But we're starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction. I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health a couple weeks ago. We were running short on surgical gowns, and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area. So we're excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, and we are proud to be part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you. The President. Thank you very much. The President.  Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Officer and President Tomislav Mihaljevic. Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a COVID pandemic. Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Officer and President Tomislav Mihaljevic. In our home State of Ohio, with an early institution of social distancing, our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with COVID infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System. We're also very grateful for the support from our State government, as well from our Federal Government. This is a battle where we're all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources, and work together as one. I'm firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us. The President. Thank you very much. Great job. The President.  Dr. Mihaljevic. Thank you, sir. Dr. Mihaljevic. The President. Thank you all. Great job. The President.  That was a terrific meeting. And thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is, compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain. Think of that—34.7, we have—and 6.6 the U.K. There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other health care facilities that are not in use at this moment. They didn't need them. We got a lot of them out, and they didn't need them. And that's a good thing that they didn't need them. But a lot of good brainpower was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions. I want to thank our Vice President for the Task Force. And I want to thank all members of your Task Force on having done an incredible job. You really have done an incredible job. Thank you, Mike, very much. Through this new partnership with the hospitals, unused ventilators will voluntarily lend them. Where they have unused ventilators, they will voluntarily lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need. Within the last several days, more than 20 of our Nation's largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them. And I've been told that if they need more, there are more there. We're going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which is—which started, but will really start about less than a month. We're going to be helping other countries, and they need it very badly. They have no chance without these ventilators. They have to have ventilators. As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients. It's the first one. These tests can be self-administered by patients in health care settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily. So by using saliva—that's a first—they'll be able to do things, in terms of speed and ease, that we haven't been able to do before. So a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time. And that's innovation. I call it ""innovation under pressure."" There's a big difference. ""Innovation under pressure."" Right? Cleveland Clinic knows all about that. As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker. There's tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration's efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it's going to roar once it gets open. I think it's going to go up tremendously. You see what's happening with the stock market already, because a lot of the very smart financial people—the great minds—they're looking at the stock, and they're saying, ""Wow."" Because they really—what they're really seeing is how we're doing. If we weren't doing well, the market wouldn't be at a level that it is today. They have a lot of confidence that we're doing the right thing and that our country is going to be open soon and our country is going to be booming. We've had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going. So I thank them for wanting to contribute. And we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders, seeking their input on how we can return to what was, until very recently, the greatest economy anywhere in the world and, I can say, the greatest economy in the history of the world. There's never been an economy like we had. Just a little bit more than a month ago, we set every record you could set: more people working than we've ever had working before—almost 160 million; the best unemployment numbers we've ever had; and the best employment numbers we've ever had. Everybody was doing well. Stock market at a record—142 days it hit a record. And I think we're going to top those records, okay? And I think we're going to top them soon, once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen. The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized, and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody. I will be speaking to all 50 Governors very shortly. And I will then be authorizing each individual Governor, of each individual State, to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their State at a time and in a manner as most appropriate. The day will be very close because certain States, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other States. It's going to be very, very close, maybe even before the date of May 1. So that will be for some States. Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape. And we think we're going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow. The Federal Government will be watching them very closely, and we'll be there to help. We'll be there to help in many different ways, as we've been—where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody has ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody can even believe. Other foreign countries—even powerful countries—can't believe what we were able to do with ventilators. Big, powerful countries. Big producing countries can't believe what we were able to do. We will hold the Governors accountable. But again, we're going to be working with them to make sure it works really well. Now, we have a list of people that I'll be speaking to over the next very short period of time—in many cases, tomorrow. We're going to have elected officials, and we'll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours. But we have a list of different industries that I'll be discussing by—meeting by telephone, because we don't want people traveling right now: the American Farm Bureau Federation—Zippy Duvall; Cisco Systems, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Corteva, Tractor Supply Company, Seaboard Corporation, Grimmway Farms, Mountaire Farms, and others in the agricultural business. In banking, it's: Bank of America—Brian Moynihan has been great; JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon; Goldman Sachs; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; U.S. Bancorp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman; Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bancorp—all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas. And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible. And I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers. I hope they're able to get that done very quickly because it's been an incredible success, and many are already spending that money, and the money has been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time. It was only a week ago. But a lot of money has been distributed already. It's going to keep our small businesses open. The construction labor workforce: International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey. These are a lot of friends of mine. The Laborers' International Union of North America, Terry O'Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel; Fluor; National Association of Homebuilders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AF of L–CIO; G.H. Palmer. So these are some of the unions, pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line. In defense, we have: Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman. These are all the top of each company—CEOs, chairmans, presidents. Raytheon, General Dynamics. Energy—we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend. It finished with tremendous credit going to Russia and Saudi Arabia. And it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day are cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that's been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50 percent of the business. It's been an amazing achievement. Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made. Maybe the biggest oil deal ever made, they're saying. I didn't know that. But we were involved in getting that done, and it was very important. We're going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry—Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy States. It's great. So we're very happy about it. I want to thank everybody. We had the—it's called OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC. And I also want to thank the President of Mexico because he was terrific. He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done. I want to thank him very much. On the energy front, we had: Exxon Mobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, Hess Corporation, Pearl Group, and a few others. Big ones. Great ones. Financial services, we have: Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson & Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliott Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; MasterCard; Visa; Chubb; Sequoia; Stephens, Warren Stephens—great; Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab, who will be here by phone. Food and beverage: National Restaurant Association; McDonald's; Darden Restaurants; Coca-Cola; Pepsi Cola; Chick-fil-A; Subway; Bloomin' Brands; Yum! Brands; Papa John's; Wendy's; Waffle House; Starbucks; Wolfgang Puck; Thomas Keller; Jean-Georges, my friend Jean-Georges; and Daniele. You know them. From the transportation world: FedEx, Fred Smith; Allegiant; United Airlines, Oscar Munoz; UPS, David Abney; J.B. Hunt; YRC Worldwide; Crowley Maritime—incredible, big, powerful shippers and transportation companies. In telecommunications, we have: the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media; Verizon; T- Mobile; Charter Communications; and Brian Roberts of Comcast. Thank you all very much. Health care: New York Presbyterian, Jerry Speyer—a friend of mine; HCA Healthcare, Sam Hazen. Thank you, Sam. Just met with Sam. Ascension Health, CommonSpirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M. Thank you, Mike Roman, for helping us with face masks. It worked out well for everybody. Procter and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific— they've been helping us incredibly with testing. Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche—and Roche has been fantastic on testing, the job they've done. I have to call them out. They have really—they have stepped up like very few. Anthem; United Health Group; Aetna; Cigna; and Humana—all the big ones. The tech companies—we have the right ones: Apple, we have Tim Cook; Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar; Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz; Salesforce, Marc Benioff; SAP—SAP, Jen Morgan; Microsoft, Satya—great job he's done. Thank you, Satya. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; IBM; Intel; Qualcomm; Cisco; Advanced Micro Devices; Broadcom. Incredible companies. Companies that no other country will catch, if they're smart. They have to be smart. But I've dealt with a lot of different countries, and I will say that no—the respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies—there's nobody even close to our tech companies. They can't catch them. So they try and buy them, but we sort of put an end to a lot of that. In sports—we want to get our sports back, so importantly. These will be some separate calls. Some will be together, by the way—lists—and some will be separate. But we have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old. But I haven't actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter, and then I get back to work. The NBA, Adam Silver; the Major League Baseball—we miss our baseball—well, this is baseball season right here. Rob Manfred, thank you very much. NFL—Roger Goodell. Thank you, Roger. UFC, Dana White. Great Dana White. PGA, Jay Monahan; LPGA, Michael Whan; USDA, Patrick Galbraith. Major League Soccer, Don Garber; WWE, the great Vince McMahon; NASCAR, Lesa Kennedy. Thank you, Lesa. NHL, Gary Bettman; from the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft; Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones; Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. And some of the thought leaders that we're going to have—and there's some others that we are having; we're just waiting to hear. But everybody's saying yes, I must say. John Allison; Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James—great person. Hoover Institute, Condoleezza Rice— another great person. Art Laffer; Steve Moore; Steve Forbes; Larry Lindsey; Catherine Reynolds; Scott Gottlieb—just spoke with Scott; Jim DeMint—and Jim has been a terrific friend; Bill Hagerty; and Ray Washburne. And religious leaders will be coming on Friday. We'll be speaking to—and we're going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders. We have incredible people, and they want to—they want to be a part. And we'll be talking about churches, and we'll be talking about opening. And we'll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me. We're going to find out how we're doing in that regard. So those are the names that we have on our list. They're the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. And they're going to give us some ideas. But we're all set, as I said. The Governors are going to be opening up their States. They're going to declare when— they're going to know when. Some can open very, very shortly, if not almost immediately. We'll give a date. But the date is going to be in the very near future. So we'll get it open. Individual Sates will—and the Governors will be held accountable. If they need things, we'll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing. We want them—because they're equipped to do testing. We've created incredible tests, and we've done more testing than anybody has ever done in the world right now. And we had a broken system, and now we have a great system. We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, ""We want to get some of those tests."" I want to thank Abbott, because Abbott came up with the first simpler tests. The first one was rough. If you were—I think it was more of an operation than a test. [Laughter] The first one was—for anybody that took it, it was not easy. But now we have a very simple test with Abbott. Now we have saliva; we have lots of other things that are happening. But we have millions of tests. Laughter The Governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job. And we're going to suggest that they check people, through tests or otherwise, coming into their States, and they run their States very strong. Eventually, we won't have to do that. Eventually, this will be gone. But for a while, we're going to do it. So they're going to take charge—at their borders, they're going to take charge of people coming in. And maybe, to an extent, depending on what they work out with their nearby State, it may be also people leaving. And they'll be able to do that very shortly. We'll be announcing a date, but it will be very short. And frankly, it will be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed—the end of April. So we think that some of the Governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that. We'll speak to them. But we're all set and we're counting on the Governors to do a great job. Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they're in a position to say, ""We're ready to go."" And that's okay. We understand that. Some of the Governors have a very tough situation. But in almost all cases, it's all starting to come down. We're very proud of the job everybody has done. And if you look at the numbers—so the minimum, as you—as portrayed—Deborah is here. Dr. Birx has been fantastic. The minimum was 100,000 deaths. And I hope to be substantially under the minimum, meaning we all hope—Mike, right?—we all hope to be substantially under. We did the right thing, because otherwise, it would have been—the projections are 2 million people. The actual projection was 2.2 million people. And if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people. That's many more. That's double the Civil War. And if you cut that in half, you're talking 5- or 600,000 people. That's what we lost in the Civil War. And that's cutting it, cutting it, cutting it. And we're not going to—that would not be acceptable. It would not be acceptable. Nothing is—one life isn't acceptable, but we weren't given that option. So I'm confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas, in addition to what the Governors have learned. The Governors have learned a lot. I've spoken to Governors that, at the beginning, it was a contentious relationship, and now it's a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship. And I'm proud to say that some of them, I think, are friends. In some cases, they're Democrats, but I think they like me, and I actually like them. I'll tell you who they are someday. But we're all getting along, and we all want to do the right thing. And I think they're going to do a great job of leading their individual States. It will be a beautiful thing to watch. They'll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials. They'll bring it right down. And Washington shouldn't be doing that. We can't be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that's 2,000 miles away where we're doing testing, but a Governor of a State can, and a mayor can, and right down the line. So it's going to be—I think it's going to be a terrific system. And if we're unhappy with the State, we're going to let them know we're unhappy. And if they're not doing the job and they can't get the job done and, for some reason, things are happening that we're not going to like—like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction—we'll have to do something that's very serious. We'll have to, maybe, close them up and start all over again. But I don't think we're going to have to do that. I think the Governors are going to come out at a time that—and these will be individual dates. And the Governors are going to come out at a time when they're ready. Some can come out very, very shortly. And we look forward to watching that process. I think it's going to be a very beautiful process. Our discussions will focus with the people that we're dealing with on rejuvenating the economy, and always health. Always health. Health and life. Living is number one. But the rejuvenated economy—and I think it's going to go quickly. We'll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the Governors. We'll be giving them what they need, if they don't have it themselves. We hope, by now, they'll be able to have it themselves. We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren't. But such great advances have been made. So we'll be dealing with them on that. And we—they can rely on us very strongly. They're going to be relying on us, I think, for some help. And we're there—whether it's building hospital beds, which I don't think they're going to need. You look at Javits Center—a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did; FEMA got involved. We actually ended up sending our medical people. That was not a COVID– 19 center, and they asked, ""Could you do that?"" And then, even after we did that, it was not used very much, meaning they didn't have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it. It wasn't that they made a mistake; nobody made a mistake. We built it—I'd rather have too much than too little, err on the side of caution. And it's really incredible what they did, including the two ships, the two great ships. And I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians. And, again, we're going to be announcing the political list tomorrow. And on there, we're going to have a lot of Senators. And we're going to be having a meeting with the Governors probably on Thursday, a meeting by teleconference. And a lot of things will be discussed, and some of the details will be discussed. But we want them to do an incredible job of running their States. I think they'll do an incredible job too. After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job. And, again, the Federal Government is there. We have ventilators if they need them. We have beds if they need them. We have hospitals if they need them. We have a testing capacity that's now second to none. We're—again, other countries are calling us. Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing. So we're there to help. And, with that, if you have a few questions, we'll take them. And if not, that would be okay too. Yes, go ahead please. Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. Jeff Mason, Reuters World Health Organization World Health Organization Q. Mr. President, two questions. First, on your announcement about the WHO, I understand your grievances with them. Q.  The President. Yes. The President.  Q. But can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic? Q.  The President. Well, we're going to be dealing with countries, and we're going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year. We have for many years—more, far more, than anybody else, including China. The President.  And I mean, look, I read off a long list of problems that we have. And we've had problems with them for years. It doesn't matter—we're looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We're doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak. But this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made—all of the mistakes that were made—it's just something we have to look at. And it is very China-centric. I told that to President Xi. I said, ""The World Health Organization is very China-centric."" Meaning, whatever it is, China was always right. You can't do that. You can't do that. Not right. And we spend—and again, it's not a question of money. But when we're spending $500 million and China is spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million—$42 million, in a case. It's—again, not money, but it's not right. So we'll see. This is an evaluation period. But in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it. And that's another way of doing it, but we have not been treated properly. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Yes, please. The President.  Federal Assistance to States/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment Federal Assistance to States/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment Q. Mr. President, you mentioned that you're going to be speaking with the—all the Governors tomorrow—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President.  Q. ——make recommendations—— Q.  The President. On probably Thursday. The President.  Q. On Thursday. What if they don't listen to you or take your advice or obey you? Q.  The President. Well, listen—— The President.  Q. Will you—— Q.  The President. All right. The President.  Q. Will you consider taking away their Federal funding? Q.  The President. I don't want to say that. They'll listen. They'll be fine. I think we're going to have a good relationship. They need the Federal Government not only for funding—and I'm not saying take it away—but they need it for advice. They'll need, maybe, equipment that we have. We have a tremendous stockpile that we're in the process of completing. We're in a very good position. The President.  Again, the cupboard was bare when I got here. Nobody ever thought a thing—in all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen. No, the Governors will be very, very respectful of the Presidency. Again, this isn't me; this is the Presidency. The Presidency has such a great importance, in terms of what we're doing. And you can talk about Constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way—I'm talking now from a managerial standpoint—is to let individual Governors run individual States and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them. Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. John Roberts, Fox News Coronavirus Testing Access/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Coronavirus Testing Access/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q. Mr. President, you talked about having testing and tracing equipment and the facility for that in place to open up the Government. Dr. Fauci said this morning that that critical testing and tracing ability does not currently exist. Q.  The President. Well, I don't know—look, I don't know. The President.  Q. Will—will—will it—— Q.  The President. Hey, John, I don't know what he said. The President.  Q. My question is: Will it—— Q.  The President. Nobody knows. The President.  Q. My question is: Will it exist by May 1? Q.  The President. The individual Governors have testing. The individual Governors—we have many forms of testing, and new testing is being developed. The President.  Our country has to get open, and it will get open, and it will get open safely and, hopefully, quickly, some areas quicker than other areas. But there is tremendous testing and the Governors will use whatever testing is necessary. And if they're not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn't open. But they'll use whatever is testing—whatever testing is necessary. Go ahead. Please. World Health Organization/World Trade Organization World Health Organization/World Trade Organization Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Back to the WHO, will you support the organization again, if Tedros is immediately replaced? Or do you want to see him step down as a possible reform? Q.  The President. Well, we're doing an investigation. I don't know the gentleman, but I know there have been problems. And it's been very unfair to the United States, just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair, and now they're coming into line. When they consider China a developing nation, and because China is a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States? Why didn't other Presidents stop this? I've been talking about it from the day I got in, and we're looking at that very, very strongly. World Trade—W—so I have a problem with World Health and World Trade, both of them. I'm not sure which is worse, if you want to know the truth, but we'll figure it out. Okay? The President.  Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. The President.  China-U.S. Trade Agreement China-U.S. Trade Agreement Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You were just criticizing the WHO for praising China as transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago. So, I mean, how do you square, your decision to revoke funding—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible The President. Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We're going to be watching very much to see. Now, it got a little bit waylaid by the virus. The President.  But look, I'd love to have a good relationship with China. But if you look—and we made a phenomenal deal. China has paid—because of me, China has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time. Billions of—some of that money has been spent to farmers, where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can't let that happen. So we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now, I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi; I think he will live up to it. If he doesn't live up to it, that will be okay too, because we have very, very good alternatives. Coronavirus Testing Access Coronavirus Testing Access Q. I was talking about the WHO—[inaudible]—Mr. President. Q.  inaudible The President. Go ahead. The President.  Q. Yes, thank you. Today: 600,000 cases, 25,000 deaths. I know you want to bring—blame the WHO, but I've spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks who say they still can't get tested and that they aren't social distancing, because they saw—— Q.  The President. So the Governors—— The President.  Q. Wait—wait a minute. Let me finish. Q.  The President. Yes. Yes. Yes. The President.  Q. So they aren't—— Q.  The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. I know—I know your question. You ready? The President.  Q. Well, no, you don't. No—— Q.  The President. The Governors—the Governors are supposed to do testing. It's up to the Governors. The President.  Go ahead please. Q. That's not the question. Wait a minute, Mr. President. That's not the question. Q.  The President. Go ahead please. The President.  Q. Mr. President, if we could just—if we could just get back May 1—— Q.  Q. The question—— Q.  The President. Quiet. The President.  Q. The question was—— Q.  The President. Quiet. The President.  Q. The question, Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Quiet. The President.  Q. The question is—— Q.  Q. If we could just get back to May 1. Mr. President, how many—— Q.  Q.——they say that they are not—that they are following your lead, that they are not social distancing. The President. The Governors are doing the testing. It's now not up—and it hasn't been up— to the Federal Government. The President.  Go ahead. Q. That's not what I'm asking. The question is about social distancing, sir. Q.  Q. Mr. President, I have a quick follow on the WHO, but if May 1—— Q.  Q. The question is if—— Q.  The President. I told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble. He's a showboat. The President.  Q. I'm just trying to ask you a question. Q.  The President. If you keep talking, I'll leave—— The President.  Q. I'm just trying to ask a question. Q.  The President. ——and you can have it out with the rest of these people. The President.  Q. I'm just trying to ask a question. I'm just—— Q.  The President. If you keep talking, I'm going to leave, and you can have it out with them. The President.  Q. It's a simple question. Q.  The President. Just a loudmouth. Go ahead. The President.  Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Coronavirus Testing Access/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Coronavirus Testing Access/Availability of Medical Supplies and Equipment Q. If you could kind of clarify: Are you basically lifting your ""Slow the Spread"" before the—— Q.  The President. No. The President.  Q. ——May 1 deadline? Q.  The President. No. The President.  Q. And then—— Q.  The President. I'm not at all. No. The President.  Q. And then—and then how many States—— Q.  The President. The Governors are going to be running their individual States. Some of them will say, ""No, I can't open now."" And some of them may last longer than we even would think. Others will say, ""I can."" The President.  You can go—I don't want to mention States, but there are numerous States that are in great shape right now. They're viewing the rest of the country like we don't even believe this is happening. We have a lot of those States. They're set to open, practically, now. I mean, they would be open now. We're going to let them open sooner than the date. We're going to pick a date. We're going to get a date that's good. But it's going to be very, very soon, sooner than the end of the month. But there are many States out there that are looking at this, and they're reviewing it, and they're saying, ""We shouldn't be even included in this."" You know, there are some that want to open up almost now. Now, if we disagree with it, we're not going to let them open. We're not going to let them open. If some Governor said—you know, has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we're not going to let it happen. So we're there to watch. We're there to help. But we're also there to be critics. And on testing—very important—we've always wanted the States to do the testing. We're now providing great testing, but the State has to provide the great testing. The State has to provide the ventilators, but they didn't do that. So we ended up going into the ventilator business, essentially, and we made tens of thousands of ventilators and we solved a big problem for the States. But we want them to do the testing, and we are there to help. Yes, please. China-U.S. Trade/World Health Organization/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S. China-U.S. Trade/World Health Organization/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S. Q. I have two questions. Or I have a question on the Governors—— Q.  The President. One question. Just one. The President.  Q. Well, I have a question on the Governors. But first, can I follow up Jordan's [Jordan Fabian, the Hill]—— Q.  Jordan Fabian, the Hill The President. One question. Go ahead. The President.  Q. Can I follow-up on Jordan's question? Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President.  Q. Do you want to walk back where you did praise China in January for being transparent about the coronavirus? Q.  The President. I'm always respectful of China. The President.  Q. But—— Q.  The President. I'm respectful of other countries. Why wouldn't I be respectful of China? In the meantime, China has paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration. The President.  They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we've done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. Let's see if they do that. And they're also paying us 25 percent on $250 billion in tariffs. So we're taking in—wait a minute. We're taking in billions of dollars for China—from China. They never paid us 10 cents. That's a great thing. Now, if they don't produce, or if we find out bad things, we're not going to be happy. But right now—and we're doing that. That's what we're doing. Look, we have an investigation underway. We're paying almost $500 million. We have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization. We will find out exactly what went on. And we may be satisfied that it can be remedied, and we may be satisfied that it's so bad that it can't be remedied. And if it can't, we're going to go a different route. Q. But that's not my question. You're criticizing the WHO for praising China for being transparent, but you also praised China for being transparent in January. Q.  The President. I don't talk about China's transparency. The President.  Q. In January, there was a tweet. Q.  The President. Well, you know, if I'm so good to China, how come I was the only person— the only leader of a country—that closed our borders tightly against China? The President.  Q. I'm talking about how you said they were transparent. Q.  The President. And by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody—you can ask anybody that was in the room. Twenty-one people. I was the one person that wanted to do it. Deborah can tell you that better than anybody. I was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don't believe everything I hear, and I closed. And if we didn't close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you're talking about— we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death. The President.  Please. Q. I'm talking about how you said—— Q.  Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Please. That's enough. Thank you. The President.  Q. ——they were transparent. Q.  Coronavirus Impact on the African American Community Coronavirus Impact on the African American Community Q. Mr. President, last week, you said that you would have data in the coming days about the coronavirus's disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Q.  The President. Yes. That's being worked on very strongly. The President.  Q. When will we have that? Q.  The President. I would say within 2 weeks. And it's being worked on. Deborah, we're working on that very strongly. The President.  Vice President Michael R. Pence. The CDC—[inaudible]. Vice President Michael R. Pence. inaudible The President. Okay, CDC is working, but we're getting reports on that. Yes, please, go ahead. The President.  Q. Hi, Mr. President, two—— Q.  Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. No, in the back. Yes. The President.  Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q. Mr. President, you're talking about reopening parts of the country by the end of the month. And if you do that, and as a result, you see a spike in cases in those areas, do you have—— Q.  The President. We may not—but we may not. The President.  Q. Do you have any—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible The President. You know, some countries have and some countries haven't. I'm watching other countries. I'm studying other countries as they open. I mean, I don't want to go into names because, for some, it would be a little bit embarrassing. But I'm studying other countries as we go along. The President.  So, on that, we have looked at every country that's opened, some successfully, some okay. No total disaster, but some okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we're going to do it very successfully. Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces. It's a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful States with capable Governors. They know when it's time to open. And we don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I'm not going to say to Governor Cuomo, ""You've got to open within 7 days."" I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I'm not putting any pressure on the Governors. Some of them don't need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they're ready to go. And that's a good thing. So we'll open it up in beautiful, little pieces as it comes along. Please, go ahead. Behind you. New York State New York State Q. Yes. Just a quick question. You spoke about Governor Cuomo. Just wondering if you have any thoughts on some of his remarks from earlier today, where he basically said that were New York to be pressured to be open, it would be a—it would cause a constitutional crisis. Q.  And he basically said that you declared yourself ""King Trump."" So I'm wondering if you heard those thoughts and—— The President. Yes, I mean, I've declared myself as king. You know, I heard he said that. But I didn't see the remarks. But he understands how we helped him. The President.  He needed help. We gave him 2,900 hospital beds; he didn't use them. We gave him a ship; he didn't use them. And I'm not saying—but I'm saying that's good, because you know what? That means he didn't need them. But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err—we said, ""Err on the side of caution,"" as I said. We said, ""Look, we don't think you need it, but if you do, we're going to have them built."" And the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job. And the U.S. Navy did a fantastic job, when we moved a ship that was not meant for COVID, and we had it redesigned for COVID. But they still didn't have very many people going in. No, we are—we'll get along just fine. He understands. We'll get along just fine. Please. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Social Distancing Guidelines Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Social Distancing Guidelines Q. Mr. President, how do you assure—how do you assure workers in States that may reopen that are fearful about going back to work for fear of getting sick? What's your—— Q.  The President. Talk up, please. Louder. The President.  Q. What's your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work, but are fearful of doing so? Q.  The President. Well, that's going to be up to the Governors. The Governors are going to want to make sure everything is safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a, maybe, weekly basis; you don't have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They can do temperature gauges. They can do a lot of different things. The President.  And you know, we're only talking about for a period of time. You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames, eventually. You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were. I want people to understand that. We're not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit. Look at the—look at this, the way this looks. I don't even like the way it looks, although I have a lot fewer reporters; that's okay with me. But look at the way this looks. I've never seen anything—John, I've never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people—we don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this. Eventually, we're going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to. I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will. I said to some of the hospital people today, ""So will people be shaking hands again?"" And I must say, I was a little surprised most of them said, ""Probably,"" because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big hand shaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, ""I think I better start shaking people's hands."" Go ahead, John. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act/Paycheck Protection Program Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act/Paycheck Protection Program Q. Mr. President, a couple of financial questions, if I could. Larry Kudlow said this morning that, at the current run rate, the Paycheck Protection money will run out very soon. The plan to re- up it is stalled in Congress. What can you do, as President, to try to move that forward? Q.  The President. Well, we're trying to get it done. The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things. Last time, they put Kennedy Center, and I hated putting Kennedy Center. And I've great respect for Kennedy Center, but I hated putting it in the bill because it's just not appropriate. Right? The President.  And—but they wanted it in for whatever reason. They had their own political reason. And, John, I said, ""Watch the way that blows up."" And it blew up. I think it blew up in their face. We want to take care of our workers. We'll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats—and also Republicans—later. But it's been a tremendously successful program. I think you see it. The banks have stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved. Money is going out. It's been a tremendous program. Really, it's been—and obviously, it was at a point where we're almost—you know, we're almost—the money will be expired, and we could use a refill for the workers. We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John. And I think that'll happen. Yes, go ahead. Please. Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/California Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/California Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Today California's Governor set out a list of six criteria for reopening the economy there. Did he consult with you on that? Q.  And also, you said earlier that there were as many as 20 States that could reopen their economies as early as May 1? Could you list some of those—— The President. No, I didn't say all of them by May 1, but there are 20 States—actually, I was given a number. Twenty-nine States are in very, very good shape. I don't want to say whether or not the Governor spoke with me about that, but we've had a very good relationship—Gavin Newsom. And—a very, very good relationship. The President.  Yes, in the back. Go ahead, please. Coronavirus Impact on Food Supply Coronavirus Impact on Food Supply Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. I have two questions. One is from a person who can't—— Q.  The President. One question. The President.  Q. But a person who can't be here. And so I—— Q.  The President. Who cares? If he can't be here, that's too bad, you know. Right? The President.  Q. All right. Well, one question that I have is about the—the United Nations economist, Máximo Torero, says that there is—there's a danger that the food supply could be interrupted during this pandemic. And I wanted to know what you're going to do about that? Q.  The President. Well, I think our farmers are incredible. They're producing levels of food, like, just unbelievable. Our transportation—that's one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food. No, we're doing phenomenally with the food. The President.  And I will say, the stores Kroger and Walmart, which has a lot of the food and many of the stores, they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven't heard that at all. We're going to be very strong on food supply. Okay, how about one more question? Go ahead, please. Federal Coronavirus Guidelines/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Federal Coronavirus Guidelines/Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q. Yes, the—the death projections that you mentioned earlier are based on full social distancing until the end of May. Q.  The President. Yes. The President.  Q. So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think are going to die? Q.  The President. Well, I'm not easing up. First of all, we'll have guidelines, even for the States that open. And they'll be guidelines. But we will not have any problem with that. The President.  Your question is a very interesting question, but the States that are opening are not States which will have a problem with that. Plus, they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished. Q. The reason they don't have a problem now is because of social distancing. So if you ease the guidelines—— Q.  The President. No, the reason they don't have is—is partially, and some of that will stay in effect. Much of it will stay in effect for a period of time. But the reason, also, is that they're different kinds of States. They have lots of room. They have fewer people and they have lots of room, and that's one of the primary reasons. The President.  I want to thank you all very much. So a lot of positive things are happening. We're going to have some very strong recommendations for the Governors. We're going to work with the Governors. The Governors are going to do a good job. And if they don't do a good job, we're going to come down on them very hard. We'll have no other choice. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Q. Is that your economic—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1240"
"4","The President's News Conference","
          May 11, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. We're here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far. This afternoon I'll also announce new steps that we're taking to make tests even more widely available. The President. To battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our Nation's disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial, all at your disposal. We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War. There's been nothing like it since. At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities. In the span of just a few short months, we've developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America. And we're opening, and we're starting, and there's enthusiasm like I haven't seen in a long time. Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our Nation has brought to this challenge. In 3 months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States. Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day. Now we're doing approximately 300,000 tests per day—a 100-percent increase—and it will go up substantially from that number. This week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country. We're testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries—and in some cases, combined. On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured. Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks. To further expand our Nation's testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is—and that we've got this all approved; it's all done—is sending $1 billion to America's States, Territories, and Tribes. So this has all been approved. We've gotten it done, completed. The money is going out. This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far. I said from the beginning that the Federal Government would back up the States and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that's exactly what's happened. This partnership has truly flourished. We have really had a very good relationship with the States and the Governors and other representatives within the States, a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years. The Governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that's, at this point, virtually unlimited. And we're sending ventilators—as you probably heard from other countries, we're sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they're in tremendous need. And I think building up a lot of good will, but much more importantly than that, we're saving a lot of lives. Most States are now doing a great job. My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 States, and Governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources. The Federal Government is also supporting States with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly. In recent weeks, we've held multiple conference calls with every State, as well as with DC and Puerto Rico. We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each State for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests. Think of that: 12.9 million tests. Today I'm announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help States meet their targets and meet them rapidly. During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to States nationwide. We already have them; the delivery will be very quick. We're prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any State is on a pace to surpass its goal. And their goals are very high. We've set them very high; we've told them to set them very high. My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing. A complicated process, but we've made it simple. As a result of these actions, every single State will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in 4 months since the outbreak began. This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher. Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon. These are all different products that were literally just developed and—if you can imagine that. And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world. And other countries are calling us, and we're trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing. My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities. Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that's in addition to all of the other sites that we have working. Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities. There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days. These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community. My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy. In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality—many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn't have at all at the beginning—126 million surgical masks—likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators. We're building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country. It's incredible, actually. This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people. It should have never been allowed to happen. It should have been stopped at the source. We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one, and that goes worldwide too—many, many countries, 184 countries, at least. Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved. And we have saved—and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we're at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom. Germany and us are leading the world. Germany and the United States are leading the world: lives saved per hundred thousand. In every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment, and we have prevailed. Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory. Day after day, we're making tremendous strides. With the dedication of our doctors and nurses—these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors—with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness. That's a phrase you're going to hear a lot, because that's what's going to happen. We're going into the third quarter, and we're going to do well. In the fourth quarter, we're going to do very good. And next year, I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had, because there's a tremendous pent-up demand. It's a demand—and I'm feeling it. I've felt things a lot over my life, and I've made a lot of good calls. It's a demand like I don't think I've ever seen. There's a pent-up demand. There's a spirit of this country like few have seen. And I think you can say—and we've helped a lot of the countries a lot. Really, a lot. There's a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing. But we're transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it's really going to be next year, and it's going to be a year like we've never had before. I really believe that. As good as we've done—and we've done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world. You can talk China, you can talk any other country—we had the best economy anywhere in the world. And we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers—a little different—where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people. All of that—we had the greatest stock market numbers ever. I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time. A hundred and fifty-two days, we set records in the stock market. We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States. All of our equipment built—$1.5 trillion plus. On the southern border, the wall is being built. It's being built rapidly. And now you don't hear the opponents talking too much about the border. They don't like to talk about it, because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things. One of the things we were right about—one of the many things was the border. We have a very powerful border. Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico—our southern border. We have very few people coming in—very, very few. Almost record low numbers. And the wall is being built. It's up to 181 miles already. It's being built. It's being built rapidly. People don't talk about it anymore because it's very successful. In the area where the wall has built—that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time. Early next year, we should be up to 450 and, very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed. But it's had a tremendous impact. But again, we've had the best numbers. The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border. And again, we're doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers. So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir—if you could, please come up and Brad, if you would—Brad Smith. And they're going to do a little explaining as to what we've done with regard to testing and how successful it's been. And then, we'll take some questions after that. Thank you very much. Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Health Brett P. Giroir. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration. And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project. Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Health Brett P. Giroir. I think it's clear that America does lead the world in testing. I'll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively. I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe. And clearly, as we've said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality. So let's start potentially with the next slide. [At this point, Assistant Secretary Giroir presented and discussed a series of slides detailing U.S. coronavirus testing capacity. He concluded his remarks as follows.] At this point, Assistant Secretary Giroir presented and discussed a series of slides detailing U.S. coronavirus testing capacity. He concluded his remarks as follows. And combined with that, the Secretary's Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of State, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need, not only testing, but in care as well. And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who's the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together. Brad. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Deputy Administrator Brad Smith. Thank you, Admiral. I want to talk through a little bit specifically the work that we've been doing with the States. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Deputy Administrator Brad Smith. So, as the admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we've been working with each State to set a target for their testing goal for May. Within—over the series of a couple of different calls, we've aligned on what those goals are. And as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May. [Deputy Administrator Smith presented and discussed a series of slides detailing Federal-State collaboration in expanding coronavirus testing capacity.] Deputy Administrator Smith presented and discussed a series of slides detailing Federal-State collaboration in expanding coronavirus testing capacity. So we hope that we've put together the right pieces of the puzzle: having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen-collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines. So thank you very much. The President. Thank you very much, Brad. And maybe you'll both stay there. Could be some questions. The President. Okay. Please, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Go ahead. Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Q. [Inaudible]—you can't hear me. We had a situation here at the White House on Friday, where a member of the Vice President's staff tested positive for coronavirus, which has now caused three of the top U.S. officials involved in the coronavirus response to self-isolate. A two-part question: Where did the system break down to allow that to happen? And where—what would you say to employers who look at the experience here at the White House and say, ""Are we ready for this?"" Q.  Inaudible The President. I don't think the system broke down at all. One person tested positive, surprisingly, because, the previous day, tested negative. And three people that were in contact—relative contact, who I believe they've all tested totally negative, but they are going to, for a period of time, self-isolate. So that's not breaking down. It can happen. It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. And so things happen. But the three tested negative. The one who tested positive will be fine. They will be absolutely fine. The President. Yes, John. Q. And what do you say, Mr. President, to other companies who may look at this and say, ""I don't know if we're ready for all of this""? Q.  The President. Well, I think, you know, we have a lot of people in the White House. And we had one. Basically, we had one person. So—and we had a lot of people that work here. This building is shocking, if you looked at the numbers. And it's also tremendous numbers of people coming in. Normally, you wouldn't do that. But because we're running a country, we want to keep our country running. So we have a lot of people coming in and out. Many of those people—most of those people are tested depending on what portion of the Oval Office area they're going in. Everybody coming into the President's office gets tested. And I've felt no vulnerability whatsoever, John. The President. But the two people, as I said, and three people, are—they have been tested, and it's negative, and be probably out of quarantine very quickly. Okay? Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Coronavirus Among White House Staff/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Coronavirus Among White House Staff/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Q. Mr. President, if I can follow up on that: Your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day. When will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day, as they go back to work? Q.  The President. Very soon. I mean, really, very soon. It's an interesting question, because normally, you would have said that ""you are not tested,"" and you would have been, you know, knocking us for not getting tested. So, if we get tested, it's a problem. And if we don't get tested, it's a problem. The President. But I like the way your question was phrased better this way, because it is a positive. We are tested; we have great capability. You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines. They're the best anywhere in the world. No place in the world has this kind of equipment. Other countries are calling—sophisticated countries—and they're calling. Lots of countries. And we're trying to make as much as we can available to them, because there's nothing like what we've been able to do in a—literally a couple of months. What they've been able to do—the private sector, what they—how they got it done. This is a 5- to 15-minute test, as an example—the Abbott Laboratories test. These tests are highly sophisticated—very quick, very good. This is things that didn't even exist a short while ago. So we do have a great testing capability at the White House. We're doing it. And I think, generally speaking—we had a call with the Governors the other day—generally speaking, without exception, they were all extremely happy with what's going on, with respect to their testing. Okay? Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q. But should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their coworkers are able to get a test—— Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——which we're still not there? Q.  The President. We're leaving that up to the Governors, as you know. And if we see something wrong, we'll call them out, and we'll stop it. But we are leaving it up to the Governors. Some are being not aggressive enough, in my opinion, and some are being a little bit aggressive, but they're being very careful. The President. And the people of the country, they've learned a lot over the last 2 months. They've learned about social distancing and washing your hands and other things that we've all learned and talked about. They've learned about—I see everybody—just about everybody has a face mask on. They've learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not. But our country has learned. Our country has been incredible. And you see the numbers; they're dropping very substantially. The numbers are dropping around our country very, very substantially. So we leave that, Jon, up to the Governors, and I think they're making a lot of good decisions. We've had, as I said, a great relationship with Governors, Democrat and Republican. And I think, overall, they're making very good decisions. Nobody in this group. All of the ones behind the rope. That's interesting. Please. Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology/Coronavirus Mortality  Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology/Coronavirus Mortality  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your comments earlier: ""We have met the moment. We have prevailed."" To you, sir, is the mission accomplished? Even with 1.4 million—— Q.  The President. No, we've prevailed on testing, is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing. You never prevail when you have 90,000 people, 100,000 people; when you have 80,000 people, as of today; when you have this—the kind of death you're talking about, when you have potentially millions of people throughout the world that are dying. That's not prevailed—— The President. What I'm talking about is: We have a great testing capacity now. It's getting even better. There's nobody close to us in the world. And we certainly have done a great job on testing. And testing is a big—is a very big, important function. By the way, some people consider it more important than others, to be honest with you. But testing certainly is a very important function, and we have prevailed. We have the best equipment anywhere in the world. Okay, please. Yes. Please, go ahead. China/Coronavirus Vaccine Development  China/Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. There are a variety of reports that Chinese hackers are attempting to steal technology related to vaccine research. Is this something you're concerned about? What can you say? Q.  The President. So what else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I'm not happy with China. They should have stopped this at the source. They could have stopped it right at the source. So now you're telling me they're hacking? So I just say this, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters]: What else is new? The President. Q. If I could follow up, sir—— Q. The President. We're watching it very closely. China-U.S. Trade Agreement  The President.  China-U.S. Trade Agreement  Q. The—if I could follow up, sir: The South China Morning Post, the Beijing newspaper, says that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favorable to them. Is this something you'd be interested in doing? Q.  The President. No. Not at all. Not even a little bit. No, I'm not interested. We signed the deal. I had heard that too: They'd like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them. The President. China has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, for decades, because we had people at this position, right here where I'm standing, sitting right in that office—the Oval Office—that allowed that to happen. No, I'm not interested in that. Let's see if they live up to the deal that they signed. Okay? Please, go ahead. Economic Stimulus Legislation/Economic Recovery Efforts  Economic Stimulus Legislation/Economic Recovery Efforts  Q. Mr. President, what are your thoughts about a second round of direct payments to Americans that's included in the House Democratic bill? Q.  The President. Well, we're talking about that with a lot of different people. I want to see a payroll tax cut. I want to see various things that we want. I want the workers to be taken care of. The President. But we are talking about that. We're negotiating with the Democrats. We'll see what happens. But as I said, it's a transition, and it's a—this is really going to be, in my opinion—we'll see, but I think it's going to be something that's going to be very special. It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well. I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is—you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus. So I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes—doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes. Like a certain party, namely the Democrats want to do. You'll mess it all up. You know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided—this administration presided—over it. It got great for a reason. And we'll do it again, and we'll do it very quickly and very easily. I see that happening. Yes, ma'am. Please. Protective Face Masks  Protective Face Masks  Q. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Almost everyone, as you noted, in the Rose Garden is wearing a mask today. Why haven't you required everyone at the White House to wear masks before now? Q.  The President. Well, if they're a certain distance from me or if they're a certain distance from each other, they do. In the case of me, I'm not close to anybody. I'd like to be close to these two gentlemen. They're hard-working, great men, but they just said, frankly, ""Let's keep it this way."" So, obviously, in my case, I'm very far away from everyone. But if you look at all of those people over there, every one of them from what I see—these are White House staffers, they're White House representatives, they're White House executives, and everybody has a mask on. The President. We've had—just about everybody I've seen today has worn a mask. Yes. Please, go ahead. Q. Is that—were you the one who required that, sir? Q.  The President. Yes, I did. I did. I required it. Yes. The President. Please. Go ahead. Coronavirus Testing Access  Coronavirus Testing Access  Q. Mr. President, you're now promising that everyone who needs a test will be able to get one at some point soon. Can you give us some figures on what you're changing to ramp up testing? When will that be a true statement, exactly? And how exactly are you going to accomplish that? Q.  The President. Well, it's a true statement already. We have more testing than any country in the world by far. But I'll let Admiral go into a little bit of the future. The President. Assistant Secretary Giroir. When you look at the testing numbers that we worked with collaboratively with the State leadership—it's not just with the Governor, but the State health officers, the State epidemiologists, the public health labs—it's really a combination of testing those who need something for diagnosis, diagnostic testing; tracing—so testing those who have been around the people with a diagnosis. Assistant Secretary Giroir. [Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows. The other thing I would say is, particularly as we move into the summer, there are surveillance mechanisms—and I talked about them before—like a weather radar. And just think about that weather radar. The influenza-like illness network, which is at about 75 percent of health care institutions and syndromic surveillance. So if we see a blip on that weather radar, combined with CDC personnel in every single State, and with contact tracers, we really run to the fire, right? And that's when you detect, you trace, and you shut off that outbreak right when it starts. Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Phil [Philip Rucker, Washington Post], go ahead. The President. Q. ——there does seem to be a double standard here, Mr. President, where members of your own staff can get tests frequently when they need it, but ordinary Americans cannot. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. So when will the rest of America have the same access that members of your own White House have to testing? Q.  The President. And you know what? If we didn't get the tests, if we did no tests in the White House, you'd be up complaining, ""Why aren't you getting tests for the White House?"" See, we can't win, because if we didn't get the tests, you'd be up—I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself—and frankly, if we didn't get tests done, you'd be up complaining about the fact that we didn't have the tests done. Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast—5 minutes, et cetera—and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win. The President. Go ahead, Phil. Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Q. Yes, Mr. President, many Americans want to return to their normal lives, but they're afraid to do so. How can you ensure Americans that it's safe to go to their own workplaces when the most secure workplace in the country, the White House, cannot contain the spread of the coronavirus that's infected some of your own staff? Q.  The President. Well, when you say ""some,"" so we have a person and the person got—something happened right after a test was done. Three other people met that person, came into relative contact—very little contact—and they're self-quarantining. That is not exactly not controlling it. We—I think we've controlled it very well. The President. We have hundreds and hundreds of people a day pouring into the White House. It's a massive office complex, including the very large building right behind us that you know so well. So I think we're really doing a very good job in watching it. And I think it's very well contained actually. And part of the reason, it is because of all the tests we're able to give. But it was one person, and the other people were only people—they're quarantined. You understand this, Phil; they're quarantined for a specific reason. The reason is, they were in the general proximity of the one person. And the one person, I believe, will be fine in a very short period of time. Vice President Michael R. Pence  Vice President Michael R. Pence  Q. Why hasn't Vice President Pence followed the CDC guidelines of self-isolation and other people who might have been exposed to that person? Q.  The President. Well, that, I'm going to have to ask that he will give you that information. Whatever he is proceeding and doing, he will give you that information. I'll make sure that they put out a notice. The President. John. Go ahead. Please. Coronavirus Impact on Children/Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome  Coronavirus Impact on Children/Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome  Q. Mr. President, up until now, it's thought that the most vulnerable people were those above the age of 60 or 70 or 80 and that children were pretty much, I don't want to say immune from this, but weren't affected by it. But all day long in the news today, we have been hearing and seeing this terrible syndrome—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——that some 85 children have now. Three of them have died. What is the Task Force talking about in terms of that? And what could be done about it? Q.  The President. Yes, we're seeing that all over the world now with young children. A very, very tiny percentage, but it's still—it's the swelling and the skin rash. And we're looking at that very closely, John. It's a phenomenon that's just been brought to everyone's attention a couple of weeks ago. The President.  Admiral, you may have something to say about that. Assistant Secretary Giroir. So thank you for pointing that out. And again, I've said many times, I'm a pediatrician and a pediatric ICU doctor. This syndrome, which we call—are similar to Kawasaki syndrome. It has been seen in a novel coronavirus before, and it's associated with illnesses. So we have a very strong activation on this. Assistant Secretary Giroir. [Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows. We know what the basic treatment is, but this is a little bit different than we normally see. So there really is an activation among all the branches within HHS, working with networks at children's hospitals and ICU nets. It is a small percentage, but it is quite frightening. And this reflects the fact that this virus affects the vasculature. We see clotting; we see strokes. And this is a vasculature phenomenon of inflammation we see in children. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome/Coronavirus Morality Rates  Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome/Coronavirus Morality Rates  Q. Mr. President, with this newly emerging syndrome now among young children, what do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this and potentially afraid to do that? Q.  The President. Well, again it's a tiny percentage. But you're right, so we're looking into it very strongly. And the admiral, as he said, he's known about this for long before this happened. But it is a very, very small percentage. And people recover from that; the children recover from that. Right? The President. Assistant Secretary Giroir. Yes, sir. Most do recover from this, but it is a serious, and it can be a fatal, condition. So we do want to make sure that parents understand that high fevers, red rashes, particularly on your child, you may need to contact your health care provider. There are treatments for this. They work very effectively if gotten early, at least for the vast majority of the cases. Assistant Secretary Giroir. The President. We're studying that very closely, and it's been on the radar for weeks actually, because we've seen this for quite a while. But it's been very rare, but we're looking at it very closely. It's very important to us. The President. I think one of the things we're most proud of is—this just came out—deaths per 100,000 people, death—so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is. Please, go in the back, please. Coronavirus Testing Access/Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia  Coronavirus Testing Access/Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia  Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions: one on the Ahmaud Arbery case and one on the coronavirus. The first on the coronavirus: The Vice President is said to be in some sort of self-isolating—keeping his distance from people. What do you say to Americans who say: ""How can you keep me safe? How can you reopen the government, if even the Vice President is self-isolating?"" And why hasn't testing gotten up to the point where every American who wants to test can get a test? Q.  The President. Well, the Vice President, first of all, has been tested, and he's negative—and was tested yesterday, tested today, and he's negative. He's in very good shape. And I think that that's going to be fine. The President. As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test. That's the problem with a question like that. We go through a whole announcement saying ""We're number one in the world by far,"" by a factor of two, and even three and four depending on where you're looking, and I get a question, ""When will everybody be able to get tested?"" If somebody wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to be tested. As far as the incident, I think it's horrible, and it's certainly being looked at by many people. I'm speaking to many people about it. He looked—I saw the picture of him in his tuxedo; it was so beautiful. I mean, he looks like a wonderful, young guy. Would have been a wonderful—I mean, just a wonderful guy. I think it's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing. Now, with that being said, as you know, they're studying the case very carefully. They're interviewing everybody involved, and we'll see what happens. To me, it's a very sad thing. I spoke to a number of people that are very much involved in it. I've been following that one very closely. It breaks your heart to watch it. It breaks your heart. And certainly, the video was a—it was a terrible-looking video to me. But you have a lot of people looking at it, and hopefully, an answer is going to be arrived at very quickly. But it's something that is heartbreaking. Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia  Shooting Death of Ahmaud Arbery in Glynn County, Georgia  Q. I have a specific question about the case, if I could ask it. Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. The specific question I have is, you've said that there possibly are things that happened that were not recorded on the tape. Could you just expound on what you mean by that and your thoughts—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——on what—[inaudible]. Q.  inaudible The President. Well, I saw the tape, and when they moved left, I don't believe—when they moved left, outside of the tape, nobody saw what was going on. Nobody saw it. It's an empty spot on the tape, I guess. The President. Now, do they have additional tapes? I hope. But I will say that it's something that, based on what I saw, doesn't look good. Somebody that I have a lot of respect for is Senator Scott of South Carolina, you know who I'm talking about. He's a great gentleman. He's a great Senator. He's a great gentleman. Tim Scott. And I called him 2 days ago. I said: ""Tim, what do you think? Tell me. What do you think?"" He's very disturbed by it. He's very disturbed. And I'm very disturbed also. Please, go ahead. Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Q. President Trump, thank you. I have two questions, one on testing and one on Democratic States that you've tweeted about. First, the money for this new testing support today comes from the CARE Act—CARES Act, which you signed into law 42 days ago. Did your delay in embracing widespread testing have anything to do with the desire to suppress the official number of U.S. cases and deaths as you try to reopen the country? Q.  The President. No, we just wanted to make sure that we had the proper machinery apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. It's a method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus, they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place. Okay? The President. Go ahead. Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Secondary Effects of Social Isolation  Resumption of Economic and Commercial Activity/Secondary Effects of Social Isolation  Q. And earlier today you tweeted that Democrats are moving slowly for political purposes. But why do you believe that their motive is politics rather than public safety? And how do you respond to criticism that you're also motivated by politics to try to grow the economy ahead of the election? Q.  The President. Well, I think that if you look at Pennsylvania, as an example; if you look at various other States—I won't get into them—the people want to go back. The numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue States to get back into gear. And the people aren't going to stand for it; they want to get back. The President. They're not going to stand for it. They want our country opened. I want our country opened too. I want it opened safely, but I want it open. Don't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route: Everything is closed up, you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too. You look at drug addiction, you look at suicides, you look at some of the things that are taking place, people are dying that way too. You could make the case, it's in even greater numbers. So it's a situation that some people—and I've noticed that some States could be moving more quickly. And also, at the same time, safety. Look, safety is paramount. But people are dying in the lockdown position too. And everybody understands that. They're just starting to find out. And look at what's going on with drugs, and look at what's happening with suicides. Yes, please. Please, go ahead. Coronavirus Prevalence Rates  Coronavirus Prevalence Rates  Q. Hi, Mr. President. So Americans have been self-quarantining for several months now, social distancing, yet we're still seeing about 20,000 new cases a day, 1- to 2,000 deaths. Is there anything else the administration is planning to do to get these new cases under control? Because we seem to be on a plateau. Or is this just a fact of life? Q.  The President. Well, excuse me. There are 20,000—the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down, and very substantially. And this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is—you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly all throughout the country, by the way. There may be one exception. But all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly. I think you see that, Admiral. The President. Coronavirus Mortality Projections  Coronavirus Mortality Projections  Q. Yes, but does this—the models, sir, are projecting now 130,000 cases that go through August. Is that—do you agree with those models? Is that your expectation as well? Q.  The President. Well, the models haven't been exactly accurate. These are models done by a lot of think tanks, a lot of universities. If you look at some of the models, they have been way off. Few of the models have been accurate. The President. But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people. And because we took—we mitigated—we did things that were very tough for our country to do, frankly. We had to turn off our whole magnificent economy. We had to turn down the whole country. We're at the lowest of all of the models. I mean, if you look at, I guess, one-hundred-and-twenty—100- to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at—there's nothing low. Look, nothing low. One is too many people. And I say it all the time: One person to lose for this is too many people. It's a disgrace what happened. But if you look at the models, we're at a low—at the lowest of those projections. But the models are not models done necessarily by the White House. They're models done by many people all over the world. And if you take the most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong. I mean, they've been wrong as far as the U.S. is concerned, because those numbers are nowhere near what was projected, potentially. Federal Coronavirus Response/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S.  Federal Coronavirus Response/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S.  Q. Do you have an expectation of what the death toll is going to look like by the summer, by the—— Q.  The President. You know what? I don't want to think about it, even. I know that we're doing everything we can. We're doing a good job. We acted very early. We acted extremely early in keeping China out of our country and banning people from China coming in, other than our citizens, which we obviously had to take. And they were quarantined or watched carefully. They were tested. They were watched very carefully. The President. But we had about 40,000 people coming in from China, from Asia, and we had to obviously take the people. Can you imagine if I said, ""You're a U.S. citizen, and we're not going to take you""? That doesn't work. So—but they were very carefully—I was with Ron DeSantis. He said they put—literally put the people that came in from China in quarantine for a substantial period of time. No, that was a big decision. I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by acting very early. And when I did this—I think the admiral can say it—everybody was against my doing it. Everybody. Everybody was: the professionals, the doctors. I was pretty much by myself on that one. And it was a lucky thing we did it, because we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Yes, please. Go ahead. Nursing Homes and Elder Care Facilities  Nursing Homes and Elder Care Facilities  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier today the Vice President urged Governors to have all their nursing home residents tested. Why not just mandate that? Why not require that? Have you considered that? Q.  The President. Well, I would certainly consider that. I will mandate it if you'd like. I would—I think it's important to do, and I think, frankly, some of the Governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes. It was obvious right from the beginning. The State of Washington, where 26 or 28 people died very early on. And I would have said, ""nursing homes."" And I did say ""nursing homes."" That's what they should. Now, some of the States—many of the States are doing that, but I think all of the States should be. They have the capacity to do it. They should be doing nursing home. That is a real vulnerability. The President. Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Coronavirus Among White House Staff  Q. Could I follow on—the two staffers that were announced last week as testing positive, are you aware of any additional White House staff—[inaudible]? The President. No, not at all. Q.  inaudible The President. Q. Thank you. Q.  The President. I'm only aware of people that saw them, were tested, the tests were negative, and they're quarantining anyway. So—— The President. Please, go ahead. Vice President Michael R. Pence  Vice President Michael R. Pence  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask: Are you now, or are you considering, separating some more with Vice President Pence as a precautionary measure? Q.  The President. Well, first of all, the job he's done on Task Force, the job he's done, frankly, as the Vice President of the United States has been outstanding. And he's a warrior too, just like doctors and nurses. I mean, he is working so hard, and he meets—he's coming into contact with a lot of people. But again, he tested negative, so we have to understand that. But he comes into contact with a lot of people. The President. It's something probably, during this quarantine period, we'll probably talk about. I have not seen him since then. But I would say that he will—he and I will be talking about that. Yes, we could talk on the phone. Q. And I have a question for Admiral Giroir, if I could. Q.  The President. Please. The President. Q. The President just said that Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn have tested negative. Then, why do they need to be isolating? Is there some concern that they could be spreading the virus in some ways? Are they concerned about the testing? Why do they need to isolate? Q.  Assistant Secretary Giroir. So this is a very fundamental concept, and I'm so happy you brought that up, because it underlies a lot of the questions here. If you test negative just at that one point, that just means you have tested negative for that point in time. We know that the incubation period for this virus can be many days. Assistant Secretary Giroir. So the CDC guidelines really says that if you're in close contact, just testing negative on that one day doesn't mean you won't be positive later on. So the prudent and the recommended thing to do is to self-isolate yourself for the entire period of incubation and, really, then some. So that's what they're doing. It's a precautionary manner, because they were negative. We all hope that they remain negative, but if they turned positive in a day or two or became symptomatic, that's still possible, even with a negative test. The President. Okay? The President. Q. Thank you, sir. Q.  The President. Go ahead. Phil. The President. Q. Mr. President, in one of your Mother's Day tweets, you appear to accuse President Obama of the biggest political crime in American history, by far. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Former President Barack Obama/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Former President Barack Obama/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Q. Those were your words. What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing? And do you believe the Justice Department should prosecute him? The President. ""Obamagate""—it's been going on for a long time. It's been going on from before I even got elected. And it's a disgrace that it happened. And if you look at what's gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that's being released—and from what I understand, that's only the beginning—some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again. Q.  The President. And you'll be seeing what's going on over the next—over the coming weeks. But I—and I wish you'd write honestly about it, but unfortunately, you choose not to do so. Yes. Jon, please. Q. The crime—what is the crime exactly that you're accusing him of? Q.  The President. You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours. The President. Jon, please. Coronavirus Testing Access/Coronavirus Prevalence Rates  Coronavirus Testing Access/Coronavirus Prevalence Rates  Q. Yes, Mr. President, if I can just get a clarification on the testing. We've seen clearly that the numbers of tests have gone up. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. There have been some advancements on testing. But you've said twice here today that every American who wants a test can get a test. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. That's not the case. One-point-nine million tests per day is far short of every American that wants a test to be able to get a test. Q.  The President. Well, I'm going to have the admiral—but I will say, just from listening and hearing, like you do—we all do—not everybody should get a test because they have to have certain things. And they're going to know when they're not feeling right. Those are the people that will be getting the test. But, Admiral, I'll let you take it from there, please. The President. Assistant Secretary Giroir. So everybody who needs a test can get a test. We have plenty of tests for that. Assistant Secretary Giroir. Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible Assistant Secretary Giroir. Right now, in America, anybody who needs a test can get a test in America, with the numbers we have. If you're symptomatic with a respiratory illness, that is an indication for a test, and you can get a test. If you need to be contact traced, you can get a test. And we hope—and not hope—we are starting to have asymptomatic surveillance, which is very important. Again, that's over 3 million tests per week. That is sufficient for everyone who needs a test—symptomatic, contact tracing, and to our best projections, the asymptomatic kind of surveillance we need to get that. And that's the way it is. Assistant Secretary Giroir. [Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows. If I became symptomatic, I would get a test. And if it were positive, I would isolate and there'd be contact tracing to stop that just the way it was done here. If I'm not symptomatic, I do the precautions as everyone is recommended in phase one. And that's the essence of safety—safely opening America. The President. And, Jon, the numbers are coming way down, and they're coming down rapidly, and that's a beautiful thing to see. And that's pretty much universally all across the country. They're coming down very rapidly. So very important. The President. Please go ahead. Coronavirus Testing Access/Meatpacking Plants  Coronavirus Testing Access/Meatpacking Plants  Q. [Inaudible]—if I can ask the admiral if—so, Americans who are going back to work shouldn't expect—and shouldn't need, shouldn't want to have the same thing that people coming to work here at the White House have, which is the ability to get tested regularly, regardless of symptoms? Q.  Inaudible Assistant Secretary Giroir. So—— Assistant Secretary Giroir.  Q. Is that what you're saying? Q.  Assistant Secretary Giroir. So let me clarify as well: People who come into close contact with the President get tested on a regular basis. Okay? If I were not in close contact with the President specifically, I would not get tested like most people here do not get tested. That's a very specific circumstance. Assistant Secretary Giroir. When I work at HHS, I go to HHS; I don't get tested. I do the exact thing that we ask Americans to do: to monitor your symptoms. If you are symptomatic, self-isolate, get tested with one of our community-based testing sites at your hospitals. There are even at-home testing now that has been authorized. And to cooperate; that if you need to be contact traced, be contact traced and cooperate with your local public health. But not everybody who walks in here gets tested every time they do. If you're symptomatic here, at HHS, at a meatpacking plant, at a school, you need to get tested. The President. And the meatpacking plants now are doing very well. There's great testing around those plants. And we're finding out who had the problem. They're being quarantined. And the meatpacking is moving along very nicely. The President. But they were trouble spots. They were hot zones, definitely. Please. And you know, one thing I think is very important though, Jon, just to finish: We have now—and nobody says it; they just don't want to write it—by far, more tests than any other country in the world. Not even a contest. And the quality of our test is the best anywhere in the world. That's very important to say. Please, go ahead. Coronavirus Testing Access  Coronavirus Testing Access  Q. So, to make sure I understand the White House's position, are you saying that right now you feel there is enough testing—adequate testing—across the United States? Or do you feel that it needs to be ramped up? And by how much, if so, does it need to be ramped up? Q.  Assistant Secretary Giroir. We've been—I think we've been clear all along that we believe, and the data indicate, we have enough testing to do the phase one gradual reopening that has been supported in the President's plan and the Task Force's plan. And it has to be a phased reopening. Nobody is saying, ""Turn the light switch on, and everyone go,"" because then it would be really impossible to control the spread of the virus. Assistant Secretary Giroir. [Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Now, I am not going to come here and say, ""We can absolutely swear it's God's truth that this is the number we need."" But we know we have enough to open, and we're going to be very careful with our ILINet, with our surveillance programs, and let the data come in to inform us even further as we grow and learn. Assistant Secretary Giroir continued his remarks, concluding as follows. And I think Brad may—— Deputy Administrator Smith. And let me just add a little bit to that, because most days, I don't come to the White House to work; I either go to FEMA, or I go to HHS. And let me just talk you through what the protocols are there, because I would never get tested if I wasn't coming to the White House. Deputy Administrator Smith. [Deputy Administrator Smith continued his remarks, concluding as follows.] Deputy Administrator Smith continued his remarks, concluding as follows. And so there's a lot of precautions that we're taking in the Federal Government that are separate from testing, and those are the precautions that the agencies use that Admiral Giroir and I are working at every day are using to let us continue working. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. If people want to get tested, they get tested. We have the greatest capacity in the world. Not even close. If people want to get tested, they get tested. But, for the most part, they shouldn't want to get tested. There's no reason. They feel good. They don't have sniffles. They don't have sore throats. They don't have any problem. If they do feel there's something happening, they have the absolute—easy. In fact, Ron DeSantis of Florida, the Governor—doing a fantastic job in Florida—he said he's got a little bit of the opposite problem. He's got so much testing that people sit around and wait for people to come in, that they have far—a great overcapacity for testing. And there are numerous other States that have told me the same thing. That's, by the way, a good problem, not a bad problem. Okay? The President. Yes, go ahead, please. Global Coronavirus Pandemic/China  Global Coronavirus Pandemic/China  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if, every day, Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more cases every day? Q.  The President. Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me; ask China that question, okay? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. The President. Yes. Behind you, please. Q. Do you want to follow up? Q.  Q. Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically? That I should ask China? Q.  The President. I'm telling you. I'm not saying it specifically to anybody. I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that. The President. Q. That's not a nasty question. Why does it matter, when—— Q.  The President. Okay. Anybody else? Please, go ahead. In the back. Please. The President. Q. I have two questions. The President. No, it's okay. We'll go over here. Q.  The President. Q. But you pointed to me. I have two questions, Mr. President. Q.  The President. Next. Next, please. The President. Q. But you didn't—you called on me. Q.  The President. I did, and you didn't respond, and now I'm calling on—— The President. Q. Sorry, I just wanted to let—— Q.  The President. ——the young lady in the back. Please. The President.  Q. I just wanted to let me colleague finish. Q.  The President. Okay—— The President. Q. But can I ask you a question, please? Q.  The President. ——ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Appreciate it. The President.  Q. But you called on me. Q.  The President. Thank you very much.

          Jun 24, 2020        ","President Trump. Well, thank you very much, everyone. Please. Thank you. Beautiful day in the Rose Garden. And I want to thank everybody for being here with us. We all know what a wonderful country and a great country Poland is. President Trump. And it's my honor to have a friend of mine here, President Duda of Poland, who has done an incredible job. And I do believe he has an election coming up, and I do believe he'll be very successful. So thank you very much and all of your representatives. Thank you very much for being here. This is the third time that we've hosted President Duda. The First Lady and I also cherish our remarkable visit to Poland 3 years ago. That was an amazing event. We had an event, because it was a speech, and a lot of people watched that speech. But it was a very historic moment and an important moment for our two countries. The American and Polish people enjoy one of the world's oldest, strongest, and most enduring friendships. Polish patriots battled by our side to secure American independence. American and Polish warriors fought and died together to defeat the Nazis in World War Two. The United States stood shoulder to shoulder with Poland in its courageous struggle against communist oppression. Our bond has been forged in battle, sealed in blood, and strengthened by our shared cultural values. The United States and Poland are united by our firm conviction that Western civilization has advanced, really—and very much advanced, I think I have to add—the cause of human progress beyond measure, and that it must be strongly defended and will, at all times, be strongly defended. And we will defend it together. In our meeting today, President Duda and I reaffirmed the vital alliance between our nations. Last year, we signed two joint declarations to increase our security collaboration, and we look forward to signing a defense cooperation agreement. Poland recently purchased 32 brandnew state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets—the best in the world—and Poland is one of only 8 NATO members—the others, some of them, haven't done so well in terms of what they're supposed to be paying to NATO. I tell them all the time. And we've gotten them up a lot, but not enough. But Poland is one of only 8 that is current with the money that they are supposed to be paying. That's the 2 percent. Two percent is a very low number. But we have a large number of countries that haven't paid. They're delinquent. Let's put it that way. They're delinquent with respect to their dues, the money they're supposed to be paying for defense. So the United States is defending a lot of countries that are delinquent on what they're supposed to be paying, and I never feel too good about that. But I will say I spoke with the Secretary General, and he said we've done a great job. But I said we haven't done good enough. We haven't done a good enough job. We have secured, though, over $400 billion in new pledged defense spending from NATO members, which is something that no other administration has come even close to. I would say they're off by many, many hundreds of billions of dollars, something the newspaper doesn't like writing about, that the media doesn't like talking about. But we will be only satisfied when all members pay their fair share. Again, only eight members, plus the United States, is paying what is considered a fair share. I also applaud Poland and the Polish people for its devotion to safeguarding their country's borders. Very strong borders. And I just left our border, by the way. The wall is moving along rapidly, and our border is about as strong as it's ever been—our southern border. Last year, we were able to add Poland to the visa waiver program. And they wanted that very badly, and we gave it to them because they really deserve it. It's a testament to Poland's vigilant efforts to uphold the rule of law. The United States and Poland have recently signed several long-term contracts for U.S. liquefied natural gas—they're a big purchaser of our energy—to enhance Poland's energy security. And we're working to conclude an agreement that would facilitates—facilitate Poland's development of nuclear energy plants throughout the purchase—they're going to be purchasing with one of our big, very good companies, technology, to do civilian nuclear energy. I want to congratulate Poland for its leadership in the Three Seas Initiative, a crucial energy partnership that will provide a reliable source of energy for Eastern Europe. And it will be free from the threat of foreign extortion. Poland understands foreign extortion very well. The Three Seas Initiative relies on fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit. Our nations have also collaborated on protecting our critical infrastructure and technology. That's why we've signed a 5G Joint Declaration, and Poland is leading the way in Europe by using trusted providers and provider equipment and supply chains for its 5G network. And we're working along with them, and they're using our companies. The United States and Poland cooperate across a truly wide range of fronts that we're both very much involved in. Here today is the head of a Polish medical team—very advanced team, very brilliant team—fighting the coronavirus alongside of American doctors: Captain Siewiera. Captain—thank you for being here, Captain. And we're making great progress. I hear we're making great progress and we're working together. But we are making great progress on therapeutics and vaccines. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being here. The American and Polish people have been true friends and trusted partners for almost 250 years. We are forever united by our shared belief in family, faith, law, liberty, democracy, and justice. As the old Polish motto goes, we will stand together in the name of God ""for our freedom and for yours."" President Duda, let me express once again our gratitude for your visit and friendship. We have had a very, very special relationship. Our alliance is powerful and a very powerful testament to what free people can achieve together. And I believe that the greatness of our relationship lies ahead. Thank you very much. President, please. Thank you. President Duda. Thank you very much, Mr. President. President Duda. Ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, I would like to thank very warmly—I would like to thank very warmly to President Donald Trump, to the President of the United States of America. Thank you very much for inviting me here to Washington, to the White House, to take part in this very important meeting to us. This meeting is important for many reasons. To me, as President of the Republic of Poland, this meeting is important because Poland is the first country after the coronavirus pandemic which has been invited to the meeting in the White House to discuss the most important matters concerning the future, concerning how the relations will look between the United States and Poland, in terms of economy, what those relations will be like in the military sphere, and what those relations will be like in the sphere of health protection—all those elements which are of key importance today. A very big part of our discussions today with Mr. President and our collaborators were dedicated to the coronavirus, to what the situation looks like in Europe and on the global stage, as concerns the fight against the coronavirus also in the United States. But, first and foremost, we're also thinking about what measures to take in the future. But, first and foremost, thank you so much, Mr. President, for your declaration that we are going to cooperate; that also our scientists are going to cooperate and collaborate on conducting research concerning the vaccine and therapy drug against coronavirus—everything that will be conducive to fighting the coronavirus. So I do believe that thanks to this collaboration, those therapeutical medicines will be available also for Poles—for my compatriots—as soon as possible. Thank you so much, President, for that because all of us know very well how high level of medical research is in the United States. And this declaration and the will of cooperation on part of the United States, on part of the President of the United States is of crucial importance to us. So thank you very much for that. But, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed the cooperation in the sphere of economy and military. Let me first mention our economic cooperation. As the President has just mentioned, we're developing it, both in the sphere of energy—in building energy security. Today we can say that the United States is cooperating in the sphere of creating energy security—not only the energy security of Poland, but also the energy security of Central Europe. The President has just mentioned the Three Seas Initiative. Yes, all the investments that are being carried out in Poland today—the extension of the capacity of LNG terminal in ?winouj?cie, we're increasing its capacity by 2.5 billion cubic meters. We also plan to construct another LNG terminal in the Port of Gda?sk. All of that is conducive to being able to receive LNG gas and provide its deliveries not only across Poland, but also for the countries of Central Europe. The vast majority of those countries of Central Europe are still dependent on Russia and creating a true alternative. In other words, diversification of supplies is of key importance for their security. Thank you, Mr. President, for this cooperation. I do believe that we're going to further develop it. Today we have got those supplies guaranteed until 2023—by the end of 2023. But I know that we are also going to enter into further contracts in this respect—even more so that, for sure, our demand is going to increase. But, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed conventional energy and nuclear energy cooperation. In the nearest future, an agreement will be signed between the governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Poland. And thanks to this agreement, we'll be able to start designing the large design of introducing conventional nuclear energy for the production of electricity in Poland. The entities which will participate in this project have already been selected, and the agreements are very advanced on the Polish side. We have got Minister Piotr Naimski, who's in charge of those negotiations right now. An appropriate intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded—finalized. We can expect that to happen in the near future. But, ladies and gentlemen, I also want to mention the contribution of the United States into the Three Seas Initiative and, first and foremost, the financial contribution to the fund of the Three Seas Initiative. Mr. President got interested in that fund some time ago. This is an element, a vehicle, which enables the development of this cooperation. Thank you, Mr. President, for your activity. And thank you for appreciating this cooperation which takes place in Central Europe within the framework of the European Union. And the goal of this cooperation is to develop, to extend the infrastructure. Thank you for noticing the possibility of developing cooperation in the transatlantic zone between the countries of the European Union and the United States. And of course, from my point of view, this cooperation with Poland is extremely important to me, but also, in the economic sphere, we are speaking about increasing military cooperation between Poland and the United States. It is also of primary importance. I have no doubts whatsoever that this cooperation will lead to the strengthening of security of the European Union; strengthening the security of the eastern flank of NATO; but also—and perhaps first and foremost, from my perspective—it will strengthen the security of Poland, and it will also lend additional financial credibility to Poland—investment credibility on part of American investors. One month ago, a global company, Microsoft, announced that they're going to invest $1 billion in Poland to establish a state-of-the-art data center. And today, officially, Google company published the information that it is also going to invest in the center of modern technologies in Poland, including IT technologies. This is going to be an even greater investment than investment of Microsoft. So, Mr. President, I have no doubts whatsoever that these American investments and this additional investment impulse that the American companies are making right now results from a very efficient policy that we are conducting together and which increases the sense of safety of our citizens in Poland, and it also increases the sense of safe investments in our country. Thank you so much for that, because that means the creation of new jobs in the state-of-the-art branch of industry IT technologies. And I'm really pleased because, in Poland, we have got a large number of excellent young IT experts, also young IT engineers. And for sure, we're able to come to terms with these very serious challenges. Also, as far as the intellectual capital is concerned, I'm sure that these investments are going to be beneficial for the United States, for the U.S. companies, and also for Poland, through creating jobs, through acquiring new experiences by young people in the first place—by young engineers. I'm also glad, Mr. President, because as we said before, the agreements that we entered into, concerning increased U.S. military presence in Poland; the agreements we signed last year, according to, first, when the U.S. forces are going to be increased by 1,000 troops in our country; and another contract—another agreement stipulated concrete locations in which U.S. soldiers will be stationed in Poland on the rotational basis, but also it's going to be a heel-to-toe rotation. Today, we are entering another stage. Namely, there is a possibility of further increase in American troops in our country. In recent days, I also talked to Secretary General of NATO. I talked to Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, and we agreed on one point: Especially as Europeans, we have no doubts whatsoever that if any part of the U.S. Armed Forces, which is the biggest armed forces in the world, was withdrawn from Europe, that would be very detrimental to European security. So, in our belief, it is deeply justified to ensure that the U.S. troops are left in Europe. So, Mr. President, thank you so much for this meeting today. Thank you so much for accepting Poland during this meeting at the White House. So we are the first country which has been received after this long break in international diplomacy. Thank you for your words about our pride and heroism of Poles, of our history. Today, Polish soldiers stand arm-in-arm with U.S. soldiers. We are tested allies. Together, we spilled blood in Iraq and Afghanistan. And we stand ready—always ready to implement our allied obligations and commitments. And thank you that the United States, thanks to your policy, Mr. President, is demonstrating itself as an absolutely loyal ally to us. And thank you that we can count on the United States. Also, I'd like to say that I'm grateful, Mr. President, that you have been stressing historical truths in such a decisive way. This is extremely important to us Poles. Fighting disinformation, defending historical truth also about the Second World War—about who started the war, about the course of the war—is incredibly important to us. And thank you, Mr. President, that you are adopting this stance and contributing so much to putting the record straight. It's important also to us, from the point of view of our dignity, the Second World War was a period of great drama and trauma in the period—in the history of our nation. We lost 5 million citizens, and that was a tragedy to us. So, because of that, it is important to spread this truth, to present it as it really was. But it's also important to speak about the heroism of Poles wherever they were fighting, wherever they were spilling their blood arm-in-arm with their allies at Monte Cassino, at Tobruk, and at other places all over the world, both on the Eastern Front and on the Western Front. All of that—saying that is extremely important. So I'm happy that today we can anchor our security in the United States. I'm glad that we have got this excellent economic cooperation. So, Mr. President, I have no doubt whatsoever that the coronavirus pandemic will pass and we will be going together towards the development of our countries, towards the development of our societies, towards the building of a better, more prosperous future, both for the United States, for Poland, and for Europe. Thank you so much. President Trump. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. So we'll take a couple of questions, and you'll ask one to me and one to the President, and that would be great. President Trump. Steve Holland [Reuters], go ahead. U.S. Troop Deployments to Poland and Germany/North Atlantic Treaty Organization  U.S. Troop Deployments to Poland and Germany/North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Q. Thank you, sir. Just, could you talk a little bit more about this issue of sending U.S. troops to Poland? Would you send them from Germany? And what sort of signal would that send to Russia? Q.  And for President Duda: How do you feel about this, taking some troops out of Germany to go to Poland? And what signal does that send to Russia? Thank you. President Trump. Well, just to start: As you know, Poland is—as I've said many times, Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO, in particular, their monetary obligations. And they asked us if we would send some additional troops. They're going to pay for that. They'll be paying for the sending of additional troops. And we'll probably be moving them from Germany to Poland. President Trump. We're going to be reducing Germany very substantially down to about 25,000 troops. We actually had 52,000, but we'll be moving it down to about 25,000. Germany is paying a very small fraction of what they're supposed to be paying. They should be paying 2 percent, and they're paying a little bit more than 1 percent, depending on how you calculate. You could also calculate they're paying—that they're paying less than 1 percent. But if you assume they're paying 1 percent, that's a tremendous delinquency. Let's use that word: ""delinquency."" So we're going to be reducing our forces in Germany. Some will be coming home, and some will be going to other places. But Poland would be one of those other places—other places in Europe. Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline/North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Russia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline/North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Q. Are you worried about the signal that it would send to Russia by doing this? Q.  President Trump. I think it sends a very strong signal to Russia. But I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia, and—through the pipeline. And I'm saying, ""What's that all about? You're spending billions of dollars to Russia, then we're supposed to defend you from Russia."" President Trump. So I think it's a very bad—I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany, and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don't like it, but that's what they chose to do. So they're spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy, and then we're supposed to defend them from Russia. So that doesn't work too well. But Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don't believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there. With all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia; we expect to get along with everybody. But Germany has—they really owe a lot of money in NATO, and this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you're probably getting close to a trillion dollars. And that's not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn't treating the United States fairly. You know, the United States is a very—is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else, by far; have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade, advantage like you wouldn't believe. So we're trying to work that out. And I would imagine they'd like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than President Trump. But after the election, they'll just have to pay more, but that's the way it is. Okay? Thank you very much. Please. President Duda. Sir, first of all, I do respect very much both Mr. President, Donald Trump, and the United States of America—a wonderful, great state which today is the largest military and economic superpower in the world. President Duda. And I wouldn't dare say to the President of the United States of America where he should send his soldiers, because this is the decision which is always taken by the United States. This is a very responsible decision. However, I do not deny that I requested Mr. President that he would not withdraw U.S. forces from Europe, because the security of Europe is very important to me, from Europe as such. I'm talking about the united Europe for which the American presence, since the end of the Second World War, is a huge security guarantee. However, if I'm asked by anybody if I am ready that Poland receives more U.S. troops in our country, of course, I am ready. In 2014, Russia attacked Ukraine. It annexed Crimea. It occupies Luhansk and Donetsk. Before that, it had attacked Georgia. 2014 was a year of huge fears—huge fears in the Baltic States and very big ones, very considerable ones among the Polish society. Today, the presence of NATO troops and, first and foremost, of U.S. troops in Poland demonstrates that article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is treated seriously. And it shows that if anyone wanted to attack Poland, it won't be a soft landing for that entity; that it won't pay off for such an aggressor, because the strongest army of the world is present and they would help Polish soldiers to defend our borders if such a case arises. One hundred years ago, we repelled Russians from Warsaw. In a great battle in 1920, we defeated the Soviet Army Bolsheviks, and we drove them back to the east. That was a great victory, but we managed to stop them only very near to Warsaw, at the outskirts of our capital city. We would never want to see that situation repeated again. That is why the Allied presence is crucially important to us today and it is a very important security guarantee to us. So I'm very pleased that both within NATO, as well as in the United States, and today, that President of the United States understands the history of Europe and he understands the realities in Europe, and that he also understands the situation as it is developing in Europe. So today, this generates peace to my country; it brings security. And thanks to that, Russian—unfortunately, the very strong imperial ambitions which have been revived over the last tens of years, I can say, because Georgia was attacked in 2008—thanks to this, those ambitions have been stopped for the time being, at least in this part of the world. And I have no doubt whatsoever that this is also a huge merit of the policy of the United States. I'm grateful for that, just like all my compatriots are. President Trump. Thank you very much. I just want to add: 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. It hasn't happened with us, and it won't happen with us either. President Trump. Please, go ahead. Poland-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Poland-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. [Inaudible]—TVN Discovery. Mr. President, you had to cancel your last trip, your last visit to Poland, because of the hurricane. Are you planning a new visit to Poland in the near future? Q.  Inaudible And the second question is on COVID. Is there a chance for Poland to participate in the development and early access, both to the vaccine and to the therapeutics? [At this point, the reporter spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.] At this point, the reporter spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows. Mr. President, is there a chance that during this cooperation with the United States we'll get fast access both to the vaccine as well as to concrete drugs against coronavirus? Thank you very much. President Trump. Yes, the answer is ""yes"" to going, and we'd like to do it again, as soon as we can. We have an election happening in this country, as you probably have heard. And so, I probably won't be able to do it until after the election. But assuming things go well, the answer is a very definite ""yes,"" actually. President Trump. As far as the joining with us on the vaccines and therapeutics, by the way, because the therapeutics to me—if I gave you a choice right now, probably, therapeutically, maybe I'd like that even better. But we're working very well on both. I think we're coming up with some great answers. I think you're going to have a big surprise—a beautiful surprise, sooner than anybody would think. But the answer is ""yes."" We will be getting Poland involved, both in terms of helping, but also in terms of taking care of the Polish people once we have the vaccine. But I think we're going to have it very soon. Okay? Thank you. President Duda. Sir, we got involved, as a state, in the cooperation and also in supporting allies, be it in a symbolic dimension of the United States in the fight against coronavirus. That is why we have here with us today a captain—medical doctor from Poland. President Duda. I want to say, ""Yes, of course, I'm working on this."" Obvious assumption that by taking part in the research and also by being, in a certain sense, cocreators of the vaccines and therapeutics, Poles will be able to count on these vaccines and therapeutics to be available for Poles as soon as possible. So, speaking openly, this is also the intention I have in my cooperation with the United States of America, to make sure that these vaccines are available to Poles and to other Nations, wherever they will be applied, as soon as possible. President Trump. Okay. Thank you very much. John [John Roberts, Fox News], please. President Trump. Police Reform Legislation/Executive Action Regarding Monuments, Memorials, and Statues  Police Reform Legislation/Executive Action Regarding Monuments, Memorials, and Statues  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. This afternoon the bill on reform in the Senate failed to move forward. It may still see the light of day at some point, but at the moment, it stalled in the Senate. As well, you have an Executive order that is coming out later on this week regarding—— Q.  President Trump. Right. President Trump. Q. ——monuments and what to do about people who deface or damage these monuments. Could you tell us what you're planning to do in the Executive order and your reaction to what happened in the Senate? Q.  President Trump. Well, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves, because there are things that they agreed to that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally. President Trump. The Democrats don't want to do it, because they want to weaken our police. They want to take away immunity. They want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we sit. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement, generally, and we can't live with that. We can't live with that. This is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who's terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator—South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen. I would like to see it happen. But we won't sacrifice. We won't do that. We won't do anything that's going to hurt our police. The police—you know, we have a record this year on crime—a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what's going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. Twenty out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular—worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan. And these are cities within the United States, Democrat run, radical-left run. You see what's going on in Seattle. You see what's going on in other places. Seattle, of all places—who would even think that's possible? Twenty out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And, frankly, they want to defund, largely—at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that, and we're not letting that happen. So if nothing happens with it, it's one of those things—we have different philosophies. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. We don't. As far as your number—your second question, I think that we're going to have a very strong Executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which—which means 10 years in jail. But I think we're going to consolidate various things. We're going to come out with a very strong Executive order, and I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We're going to have it very—a very powerful statement. We've arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they've done to monuments, statues, and even buildings. So we have very strong laws already in the books, and we have a law that's 10 years. It's 10 years. That's a long time to have fun 1 night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is, when they knock down Grant—when they want to knock down Grant. But when they look at certain—now they're looking at Jesus Christ. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not as long as I'm here. As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we're going to have a very strong Executive order, and it'll happen very quickly, before the end of the week. Poland-U.S. Relations  Poland-U.S. Relations  Q. And to President Duda: President Duda, we have an election coming up in November; you have an election coming up on Sunday. Some of your critics, who are politicians here in the United States, have criticized this visit to the White House, saying it is tantamount to election interference because it shows a very close relationship between the United States and Poland at a time when you really need it. What do you say to those critics? And, Mr. President, feel free to weigh in if you want to. Q.  President Duda. Sir, first of all, let me—let me also follow up on that question that you asked to President Donald Trump. President Duda. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, because among others, not a long time ago, the monument to General Tadeusz Ko?ciuszko was devastated. That was the national hero of Poland, but also the national hero of the United States. He was fighting for the independence of the United States. He had great merits and he was also the commander of a Polish uprising where he was fighting for the independence of Poland. He suffered heavy wounds in Poland, fighting for the independence of our country. And for completely incomprehensible reasons to us, that monument was devastated recently. And thank you so much that it has been renewed so fast and that made it possible for me to lay flowers at that monument and pay tribute to the great soldier and a great commander. Thank you for that. That was outrageous for a big number of Polish people back in Poland—all of them probably—and for many, many Polish people living here also in the United States. Polish organizations here in the United States asked me and told me that they would renew that monument. I know that it has already been renewed by the United States. No assistance was needed, so I'm very grateful for that, here, that monument of Tadeusz Ko?ciuszko stands near the White House and he looks as he should look, which he has deserved for the merits he laid for the United States and for Poland. So thank you very much for that, Mr. President. And answering to your question: Two months ago, at the very beginning of the pandemic of coronavirus, we had a lengthy conversation with President Donald Trump. The pandemic disrupted the plans of our cooperation, which we had. And back then, we made an arrangement with Mr. President that we would meet as soon as it would be possible, and this has been implemented. And the fact that this arrangement has been put into force is demonstrated by the visit today. I'm very grateful to Mr. President for inviting me here today. And together with Mr. President, we are implementing our Presidential duties. The President is always in charge of his national interests, and this is the task of the President. When the President is acting in the international sphere—and this is my sense, but I also know that also it is a very strong belief of President Donald Trump—the President is supposed to realize the interest of their country. So, Mr. President Trump is realizing the interests of his own country, and I'm realizing the interests of Poland. So we're looking for a win-win situation, where both parties are the winners, where both parties are able to implement their interests as part of the cooperation which we're implementing. This is the way we act. And in this very moment, we are acting on a national level, on the state level. We are just fulfilling our obligations and duties as presidents of our countries, as those who are representing our nations and who want our societies to have as good lives as possible. Thank you very much. President Trump. I can say that President Duda is doing very well in Poland. He's doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him and, by the way, Mrs. Duda, who is a terrific woman, a terrific woman who we've gotten to know also through our various travels and meetings. But they think the world of him, and I don't think he needs my help. President Trump. I'm honored that this is a day that's, I guess, just before your election. I'm honored. But he will do very well with or without us. He's going to have a great success, and Poland is going to continue on. They're doing incredibly well as a country. Okay, please. [President Duda spoke briefly in English to President Trump as follows.] President Duda spoke briefly in English to President Trump as follows. President Duda. Thank you very much, Mr. President. President Duda. President Trump. Thank you. President Trump. President Duda. Best regards to Madam Melania, to your wife. President Duda. President Trump. Thank you. President Trump. President Duda. [Inaudible]—Polish Television. President Duda. Inaudible Russia-U.S. Relations/Arms Control/Poland-U.S. Relations  Russia-U.S. Relations/Arms Control/Poland-U.S. Relations  Q. Good morning. [Inaudible]—Polish Television. I want to ask about timing of the visit. President Andrzej Duda is the first President, the first international guest in the White House since the lockdown. And today, there was a big military parade in Moscow. Can we combine those two facts? Is it, kind of, proof that America—that Poland is an important partner for America? Can we treat it that we can rely on America in Poland? Thank you. Q.  Inaudible President Trump. Well, I think you can, and we also are working with Russia right now on an arms treaty, which is a very big thing—nuclear arms, specifically. President Trump. But we're working very much, and we're—I think I can say, Mike, we're doing very well on that. We're two countries that want to see it happen. And we're working on other things with Russia. We have a very good relationship. We have our Ambassador over there right now, who'll be attending certain festivities, and that's a good thing. And I think that's, frankly, a good thing for Poland also. Likewise, we're going to be having very important dignitaries at your parade. You're going to be having a very big event soon, and we're going to be—I guess, in August—and we're going to have people representing the United States at a very high level. And that's very important to us also. Okay? Please. President Duda. Sir, I have this feeling and sense that I'm conducting negotiations in Polish matters here, in very experienced and very tough politician—a tough player, I can say—that is President Trump, who is standing strongly and looking to the interests of his country and his citizens. President Duda. What I'm doing here is I'm representing Polish interests here, and I'm not parading in Moscow. That is all. Thank you very much. President Trump. Thank you all very much. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. President Trump.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland-1"
"6","The President's News Conference","
          Jul 21, 2020        ","The President. Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon. Today I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control. It seems largely in Sun Belt, but could be spreading. The President. My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We're working very hard on it. We're making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We'll call it ""phase four."" I think we're going to get it done. We'll protect our workers, our schools, and our families and protect them very strongly. As one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We're doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development. But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave. My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We've learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them. And again, the vaccines are coming, and they're coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years. If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years. The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we've learned a great deal about it and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful. We've developed them as we go along. Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better, something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is. It's the way—it's what we have. If you look over the world, it's all over the world, and it tends to do that. The Governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent. Everything they need, they get. And we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it's ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that's a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards. The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care. In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it's heart or diabetes, but usually, it's some kind of a condition. It seems that people have that. And if they do, it's a problem, no question about it. Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won't even know they're sick. They won't have any idea that they have a virus. They won't have any idea at all. America's youth will act responsibly, and we're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They'll have an effect. And we need everything we can get. Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk; 99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that's much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people. By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we've been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we'll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment. And we have many more happening and coming out. We've learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we've shared them all over the world. But the relationship with other countries has been very strong. We're all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators. And when you're on a ventilator, we've learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators. But the doctors have become incredibly—and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure. And allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization. And that's something that they've really started. They're using it much earlier. Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April. It's a great number. As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit States, which you're looking at right now, we're surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics. We again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly. Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you'd think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly. But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they've been suffering from this virus for a long time. We've done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it's something that we can talk about, but we're working, again, with them, because we're helping a lot of countries that people don't even know about. I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators; they have to get them. They're very hard to get. We're making thousands now a month—thousands of ventilators a month. It's been quite amazing. And we keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better. We'll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on. But you'll see them. There'll be put up as we go. In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one-half of what it was in April. We've learned a lot. We've learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators, but in many other things. And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera. But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus. And that's what we have: We have a relentless focus. And it's been that way from the beginning. But we have learned so much. As you know, in recent weeks we've seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our South; you look at South, Southwest, and West. This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic. We're also facing the challenge of a significant spice [spike]* in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the President, a great gentleman, was here 2 weeks ago. And they have really been hit hard. Because we've achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in 2 months, we're successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases: some cases so mild that you really don't even treat them; some cases with children, where they don't even know that they're ill. And I guess they're not very ill, because they recover almost immediately. Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50-percent more tests than Europe, and we've conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined. We'll be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms. So we know exactly where it's going and when it's going to be there. We're also working to reduce turnaround time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all Governors, but right now, in particular, those Governors. We're coordinating closely with hospitals and Governors. In the last 3 weeks, I've sent senior officials into nine States to meet with Governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the State, including hospital administrators, et cetera. My administration currently has zero unfilled requests for—unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the Governors. No Governor needs anything right now, and we think we'll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go. We have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that's helping us greatly. I want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We're closely monitoring hospital capacity in these States. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries. We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the Governors we've spoken with say they have enough bed capacity. That's a great thing. Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators. And a permanent shutdown was really never an option. In terms of what we're doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns. And we've saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we're very aware of this disease. We understand the disease, to a large extent. And nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we'll end up with a cure, we'll end up with therapeutics, we'll end up with a vaccine very soon—all three. We're instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene—wash your hands every chance you get—while sheltering high-risk populations. We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We're surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South. We're being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we've had with so many people—so sadly, they were infected—so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That's really the high-risk people—the high-risk, wonderful people. Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic, but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we're mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately. And logistically, we have the military ready to go. We have great people—logistic, military people; a wonderful general who's waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That's what's going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that's necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all. And I'll take a few questions if you'd like. I will say this: I want to thank all of the staff: the White House staff, all of the doctors that we've been working with so closely. And it's—just a lot of very positive things are happening. It's a nasty, horrible disease that should have never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world, and the world is suffering. But we're going to get it taken care of, and we're helping lots of other countries. Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Frequency of the President's Coronavirus Tests  Frequency of the President's Coronavirus Tests  Q. Mr. President, first, I just wanted to get a clarification. Your Press Secretary said today that you sometimes take more than one test a day. Why is that? And how often is that? Q.  The President. Well, I didn't know about more than one. I do take probably, on average, a test every 2 days, 3 days. And I don't know of any time I've taken two tests in 1 day, but I could see that happening. The President. Coronavirus Testing Access  Coronavirus Testing Access  Q. So Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have both said they want to see more money for testing. They want to send billions of dollars to the States so they can do more testing. And you probably saw Mick Mulvaney the other day said that his kids, it took them a week to get test results back. He said this is ""simply inexcusable"" given where we are in the pandemic. Do you think we have a problem with testing in this country right now? And are you in favor of more money for testing? Q.  The President. Well, we've done more testing, by far, than anybody. Some of the tests—because it is massive volume—it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick; they're 5 minutes and 15-minute tests. And those are, frankly, the ones that I prefer. The President. But we're doing massive numbers, and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now which give you a 15-minute and a 5-minute test. So we'll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They're also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it's a good thing if we can do that. Q. Are you in favor of more money for testing? That if Republicans want—— Q.  The President. Well, they're going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we're leading the world. And I think the second country at 12 million. We're going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million. Then, you have 7 million, 6 million, and 4 million. I think that we are doing a tremendous amount of testing. But if the—if the doctors and the professionals feel that even though we're at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible, that they would like to do more, I'm okay with it. The President. White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah L. Birx  White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Deborah L. Birx  Q. Why aren't your doctors not with you here today? Where's Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx? Q.  The President. Well, Dr. Birx is right outside. The President. Yes, please. 2020 Presidential Election/The President's Accomplishments  2020 Presidential Election/The President's Accomplishments  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have got two questions for you, if that's all right. Number one, I just wanted to know, in November, do you want the American people to judge you—— Q.  The President. Could you speak up, please? The President. Q. Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you've handled this pandemic so far? Q.  The President. This, among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year. I think we're going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter. But I think next year is going to be a record year, and I think they're going to judge me on that. The President. I think they're going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody has ever done to the extent that we've been able to do it. On rebuilding the military, on how we've handled the VA: On the VA, we got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's been many decades. They've been trying to get Veterans Choice. It's called ""Choice,"" where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait on line for 2 weeks or 5 weeks or 2 days. And frankly, that's been a great thing. And Veterans Accountability, I think they'll judge me on that. They'll judge me on all of the things we've done. I don't think—and I think we can say this with surety, and it's never ever been even challenged. In 3½ years, the first 3½ years—the first years of a Presidency—I don't think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we've accomplished, from energy to health to so many other things. And then, this came in, and the plague—I call it the ""plague""—the plague came in, a terrible thing. Should have been stopped. Wasn't stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that, and now we've started them up. And I think we've really started it up very successfully. Yes, please. Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've been saying for months the virus would simply disappear, and now you're saying that it's likely to get worse before it gets better. If it does keep getting worse, if Americans keep dying, are you responsible for that? Q.  The President. Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I think that—I always like to say, as—you know, either way, when you look at it, the Governors are working with me. I'm working with the Governor. We're working hand in hand. I think we're all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the Governors. Very, very good relationships. The President. I could say I'm fully responsible. But you know, one day, we had a virus come in, and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. And nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily infected China. Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe—coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have—if it's one person, it's too much. But we're at, let's say, 140,000; we could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn't. So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened. China should have stopped it. Please. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Yes, go ahead. Please. The President.  Coronavirus Testing Access  Coronavirus Testing Access  Q. Thank you, President Trump. If I could, two questions. My first question is: We have a very quick testing platform here at the White House. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. It's great. You get tested; you know very quickly. Do you think that it would be easier to reopen and restart businesses if we could produce more of those machines for people? Q.  The President. We're trying to do that. That's a great question. We're trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in—and you know, it goes through the mail 1 day, comes back another day, no matter how they send them. It's a day and a day, so that's 2 days already wasted. And then, if it spends—by the time you get it back, it's 3 or 4 days, if they do an efficient job. We're trying to get the testing on site. The President. Q. Thank you. Q.  The President. I like it the best. The President.  British Socialite Ghislaine N.M. Maxwell  British Socialite Ghislaine N.M. Maxwell  Q. And my follow-up—my second question; it's a little bit different topic, but it's one that a lot of people are talking about. Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she's going to turn in powerful people. And I know you've talked in the past about Prince Andrew, and you've criticized Bill Clinton's behavior. I'm wondering, do you feel that she's going to turn in powerful men? How do you see that working out? Q.  The President. I don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is. I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. I just don't know. I'm not aware of it. The President. Yes, please. Go ahead. Q. Mr. President—— Q. Unemployment Insurance/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Unemployment Insurance/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, sir—thank you, sir. On unemployment insurance, how much below $600 are you willing to go? And you've said that the economy is bouncing back strong, so why do we need to even cut it at all? Q.  The President. Well, the economy is getting stronger, and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially if some of the things that I just spoke about work. The President. We want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be, sort of, forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make. And the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work. So that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well because it gave people a lifeline, a real lifeline. Now we're doing it again. They're thinking about doing 70 percent of the amount. The amount would be the same, but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts so that people are going to want to go back to work, as opposed to making so much money that they really don't have to. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. But we were very generous with them. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful, if you look. I mean, we have—we're in a pandemic, and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible. Okay? The President.  Please. Protective Face Masks  Protective Face Masks  Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Yesterday you said that wearing a mask was an act of patriotism. If that is the case, why don't you do it more frequently? Q.  The President. Well, I do. I actually do it when I need. I mean, I carry the mask when I have to go—I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here, and I carry it. And I will use it gladly. No problem with it. And I've said that. The President. And I say: If you can, use the mask. When you can, use the mask. If you're close to each other, if you're in a group, I would put it on. When I'm in a group—if I'm in an elevator and there are other people with me, including, like, security people, it's not their fault. They have to be in the elevator; I want to protect them also. I put on a mask. I will have—I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way: Anything that potentially can help—and that certainly can potentially help—is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times, and I'll continue. Please. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you—— Q.  Q. A quick follow-up. Can I ask you a quick follow-up? Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. Q. Are you sending mixed messages though? Yesterday you tweeted out an image wearing a mask. And then, last evening we saw you not wearing a mask at your hotel. The President. Q.  The President. Well, I don't know. The hotel—I was pretty far away from people, but I would say this: I've explained it, I think, very well. If you're close together, I would put on the mask, and if you're not—I would say that if you're—for instance, I'll see—like, here, you've been all tested; I've been tested. Oftentimes, I'll be with people that are fully tested; I've been tested. In theory, you don't need the mask. I'm getting used to the mask, and the reason is—think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps. The President. Now, we have experts that have said, in the recent past, that masks aren't necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they've changed their mind. If they change their mind, that's good enough for me. So I wear it when appropriate. Please. Q. And, on testing, quick question—— Q. Protective Face Masks/Social Distancing  Protective Face Masks/Social Distancing  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir. A lot of Americans, though, may be surprised at your change of tone over all of this, a more, perhaps, realistic tone. Some would look at it that way. The sudden embrace of masks, social distancing, the—— Q.  The President. Well, I've always agreed with that. I mean, I've never fought either one. But certainly, social distancing, I want to—it's—that's common sense. The President. Q. The idea that things—— Q.  The President. Six feet, to me, is common sense. I'd like to say maybe make it a little bit further. The President. Coronavirus Prevalence/Florida/Texas  Coronavirus Prevalence/Florida/Texas  Q. The idea that things will get worse perhaps before they get better here, and perhaps the realization that this resurgence, if you will, is for real—when you used to talk about it in terms of little fires being put out here and there. Would you respond to that? Q.  The President. We have them too. No, we have embers and fires, and we have big fires. And unfortunately, now Florida is in a little, tough—or in a big, tough position. You have a great Governor there. You have a great Governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people, and I think they're going to handle it very well. The President. Their hospital capacities are holding up, but Texas is a big State, and it's very well run, and so is Florida, and I think they'll do a very good job. Q. Are you changing your tone though, sir? Q.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Q.  The President. Yes, go ahead. The President. Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. I just wanted to ask you about the issue of vaccines, which you already mentioned. Yesterday a study by a Chinese company showed some promising results for its coronavirus vaccine candidate. If China were first in developing the vaccine, or even if it weren't, would the administration be willing to work with China to bring a successful Chinese vaccine to the U.S.? The President. Yes, we're willing to work with anybody that's going to get us a good result. We're very close to the vaccine. I think we're going to have some very good results. We're already in testing; nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to 2 years before you can even think about using the word ""testing."" Q.  The President. So I think we've had a lot of—and the reason we're testing: They've had good results. So now we have to see—and the testing also for safety, because they have to make sure it's safe. And I think you're going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe very short period of time, having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good. So we'll be doing these quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of this, and we'll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy, which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day, because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front too. Thank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1243"
"7","The President's News Conference","
          Jul 22, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval. Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly. And we think we have a winner there. We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines, long ahead of schedule. The President. As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter. This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time, really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules. I want to thank the FDA. I want to thank everybody involved. It's been an incredible process. As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know. The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. That's really something. In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities. So we know what to look for. From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors. In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities. And we gave it a very strong priority. FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it's going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country. Today I'd like to provide an update on the additional actions we've been able to take, and they've been very constructive. First, we're requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in States where you had the worst outbreaks. All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We're distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort. These are the tests where it takes 5 minutes to 15 minutes. They're very accurate. They're very good. And we're sending them all over the country. And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities. Second, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes. Nursing homes in higher risk areas will be receiving more funding. This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families. And they can connect to their families. They are having a tremendous time. They want to be with their loved ones. They can't do it, so what we're doing is we're working it so that we can connect—have them connect with their families if they're not able to visit. Third, we've been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the Governors so that the Governors and their staffs can take appropriate action. We're able to find—because of the testing programs and other means, we're able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The Governors can then take action. Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest risk nursing homes. And that's their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest risk nursing homes. CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most. And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed. Over the past few months, we've created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks. And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data. When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the State and make sure that it responds very quickly. We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly. I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life. We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope. The light is starting to shine. We will get there very quickly. But we send our love; we send a message of love—very important. We're with you all the way. As far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West. We're closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida. Arizona is starting to come down. Done a very good job. They're all doing a good job. They're very talented people. There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations—which you know very well about—which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause. Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places—maybe beaches—four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide—likely also contributed. We're also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the President, and it's a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere. Two hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in. And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that's helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we're doing right now and for the pandemic. Nationwide, beyond the outbreak in several States, cases remain low and very stable. Nineteen States have positive test rates of less than 5 percent. Eight States have positive test rates of less than 2 percent. Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April. It's coming down. It's coming down fairly rapidly. Today we surpassed—first time—we surpassed 50 million tests. That's far more than any country in the world. India is second, we believe. We think—1.4 billion people; that's about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests. We're working with every State to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill. We're working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes—everybody. The remdesivir has proven to be terrific. Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower. The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids. A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn't have known a number of months ago. We're doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines. And frankly, therapeutically—or maybe a word even beyond that word is ""cure""—would be the best of all, and we'll see what happens. But that would be great if we could go into the hospital and just cure people. And we're at a position where we're actually able to, to a certain extent, with what we have right now. And we think, in a very short period of time, we'll be able to do that. Our strategy is to shelter the highest risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant. Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands. Practice very, very good sanitary means. You have to do this. You have to just—you have to look at it differently. Wash your hands often. I'm finding more and more people are saying, ""Wash your hands."" So wash your hands. We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. And we're all in this together. And as Americans, we're going to get this complete. We're going to do it properly. We've been doing it properly. Sections of the country come up that we didn't anticipate—for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera—but we're working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it's all going to work out, and it is working out. So, with that, I'll take a few questions, please. Yes, please. Crime in U.S. Cities/Federal Coronavirus Response  Crime in U.S. Cities/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you a question about the surge of Federal agents to various cities. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. The mayor of Chicago just said, moments ago, that you're doing this to divert attention from your failures on coronavirus. You are only targeting cities—— Q.  The President. But we haven't had that failure. And—— The President. Q. You are only targeting cities, though, run by Democrats. Is this just a political stunt? Q.  The President. Yes, the cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats. You have radical-left Democrats running cities like Chicago and so many others that we just had a news conference. And unfortunately, that's the way it is. I mean, that's the facts. The President. When you look at Chicago and you look at the job—Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday, and I think, in their own way, they want us to go in. There'll be a time when they're going to want us to go in full blast, but right now we're sending extra people to help. We're arresting a lot of people that have been very bad. As far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we've done some amazing things, and I think you'll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries. And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you're going to see—and especially into the future, with what's happening—you're going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States. Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], please. Q. Just to follow up on that, sir, real quick? The President. Go ahead, Jon. Q.  The President. School Reopening Efforts/National Economy/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  School Reopening Efforts/National Economy/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  Q. Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely? And regarding the children in your family—your son, your grandchildren—are you comfortable—do you plan to have them back in person, in school this fall? Q.  The President. Yes. Well, I am comfortable with that. And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately, it's up to the Governors of the States. I think most Governors, many Governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open. The President. We just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an alltime record on housing price increases, up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record. It's never happened before. That's a great sign. We have an economy that's going to be booming. It's going to be—a lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly—meaning over the next week or so—and I think it will be a continuation of the last 2 months. The last 2 months have been incredible. So I think we're going to have a great economy. You're going to have a fantastic next year. I think you're going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, they'll be announced just before the election. They'll be announced around November 1. So yes, I would like to see the schools open, open a hundred percent. And we'll do it safely; we'll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read, having to do with children and—and safety, they're very impressive. They have very strong immune systems. Q. But you would understand that the—— Q.  The President. Please. The President. Q. ——the children who go to school then go back to home, they're with—some live with their grandparents. Q.  The President. Sure. The President. Q. That there's a real risk. Would you understand if some schools—— Q.  The President. Well, they do say that they don't transmit very easily. And a lot of people are saying they don't transmit, and we're looking at that. We're studying, Jon, very hard that particular subject: that they don't bring it home with them. The President. Now, they don't catch it easily; they don't bring it home easily. And if they do catch it, they get better fast. We're looking at that fact. That is a factor, and we're looking at that very strongly. We'll be reporting about that over the next week. Please. Protective Face Masks  Protective Face Masks  Q. Mr. President, at least three Governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. Is that something you wish all the Governors would do? Is that something you would encourage? The President. Well, a lot of the Governors, they have different requirements. Some of the Governors are very strong on masks; others aren't. I think it's really going to ultimately be up to them. Q.  The President. We've given them the facts. We've given them everything we know. They have their own facts. Some are strong on masks, and, as you know, some aren't in the same ballpark. But I think—— Q. Shouldn't they all be? Q.  The President. Well, I think all are suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it. I bring one. I have one. I've worn it. And I think when I'm in certain settings, like hospitals and various—or when I'm close—when, you know, when you can't socially distance, I believe in it. Let's see: Do I? I do. I have it. The President. And if—you know, in certain—in certain instances, I think you really—I think you want to travel with a mask. There are instances where you really can use it. I would believe it would be a good thing. Yes, please. Q. Sir, one, just, follow-up: DC Mayor Bowser came out with such an order today. It, of course, doesn't apply to Federal properties, but would you encourage Federal properties—and including the White House complex—to follow the order? Or on military bases? Q.  The President. We're going to make a decision over the next 24 hours. We'll let you know what that decision is. Okay? The President. Q. Thank you. Q.  The President. Thank you. The President. Please. Economic Stimulus Legislation/National Economy  Economic Stimulus Legislation/National Economy  Q. President Trump, do you agree with Senate Republicans discussing the possibility of extending short-term unemployment insurance today so that they prevent benefits from expiring? Q.  The President. Well, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that: Republicans, Democrats. And right now a lot of my representatives are on the Hill. They're discussing CARES Act or phase four, whatever you want to call it. And I think, ultimately, something good will come out of it. The President. The economy is starting to really come back strongly, when you look at the numbers—even with the fact that—like California is still closed up and many big States. I think the numbers are even more impressive, considering that some States like California—big ones—are pretty well shut down. So we expect to have something over a period of time—over the appropriate period of time. Please, go ahead. Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities  Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities  Q. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. These two questions are with Andrew Feinberg [Newsweek] and J.C. Bua [Talk Media News]. One is: Today you said you're sending Federal law enforcement officers to run cities run by ""extreme politicians""—that's the word you used—which—who happen to be all Democrats who have supported Black Lives Matter protests. Q.  The President. I didn't say I that. I didn't say who supported—— Q. Millions of Americans voted for these people—— The President. Q.  The President. No. I said Democrat politicians, and these are the cities where you have the problem. If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit, if you look—I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems. And we're sending them help, but we're really waiting for them to call for the big help, for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing, and able. The President. You look at Chicago, where 14 people were shot yesterday; where, over the weekend, many people died, and many people were shot; and, over the last month, they're setting record numbers. We are waiting for the mayor, respectfully, and other mayors and Governors to call us. We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force. Now, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting. We know who they are. We're working with police forces. And even though, in some cases, they're told, ""Don't work with the Federal Government,"" the police forces have great respect for the Federal Government, what we do. But we're ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting. And we're going to help. Please. The President's Science and Health Advisers  The President's Science and Health Advisers  Q. I have a question on crime. But first, I don't think we really got an explanation yesterday on why the health experts are no longer joining you at these briefings. Can you explain why? Q.  The President. Because they are briefing me. I'm meeting them. I just spoke to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Birx is right outside. And they giving me all of—everything they know, as of this point in time. And I'm giving the information to you, and I think it's probably a very concise way of doing it. It seems to be working out very well. The President. Q. Okay. So, on crime—— Q.  The President. But they're very much—they're very much involved. They're very much—the relationships are all very good. All very good. The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary. The President. Kayleigh is here, and I think you would say the same thing. You work with them all the time. Yes, go ahead. Please. Crime in Chicago, Illinois/Former President Barack Obama/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities  Crime in Chicago, Illinois/Former President Barack Obama/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities  Q. So, on crime: In 2016, you said it was President Obama's fault that homicides were up in Chicago. So why was it the President's fault then, but it's not your fault now? Q.  The President. Chicago is a disaster. The mayor is saying, ""Don't come in."" The mayor is telling us not to come in. At some point, we can void that if we have to, but we—and we may have to, at some—because it's out of control. I assume she's saying that for political reasons. I think it's negative political reasons. The President. She's a Democrat. I'm going to be nice. She's a Democrat. She's making a big mistake. People are dying in Chicago and other cities, and we can solve the problem. They have to ask us, but—— Q. Right, but—— Q.  The President. ——we can solve the problem. The President.  Q. ——why was it President Obama's fault in 2016? You credited it as him being in office. Q.  The President. Because President Obama was invited in, and he did a poor job. President Obama could have gone into Chicago. He could have solved the problem, and he didn't. In our case, they don't want us in. We can solve the problem very easily. We're equipped with the best equipment, the best people. The President. And you see what we're doing. I mean, Portland was coming down; it was busting at the seams. And we went in and protected all the Federal buildings. Those Federal buildings are totally protected. But—and we had to do that. And Portland is a very different place than Chicago. But Chicago should be calling us—and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others—to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend—many, many people; you see the same numbers as I do—when you're losing these people, they should call us, and they should say, ""Come on in."" And it's incredible to me, but they're not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point, we may have no other choice but to go in. Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], please. Trump Turnberry Resort in Turnberry, Scotland/China-U.S. Relations  Trump Turnberry Resort in Turnberry, Scotland/China-U.S. Relations  Q. Mr. President, are you looking at closing further Chinese Embassies in the United States? Q.  And did you ask Ambassador Woody Johnson to bring the British Open to your Thurnberry—or Turnberry property in Scotland? The President. No, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that, about Turnberry. Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know, one of the best in the world. And I read a story about it today. And I had never—I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that. No. The President. As far as closing additional Embassies, it's always possible. You see what's going on. We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close. And everybody said: ""There's a fire. There's a fire."" And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers, and I wonder what that's all about. Okay, how about one or two more? Please. Impact of the President's Policies on the African American Community  Impact of the President's Policies on the African American Community  Q. Yes, thank you. Would you like to respond to Joe Biden, who, today, described you—you might have heard that—as the first racist to be elected President. Those are his—that was his words. Q.  The President. Well, you know, it's interesting because we did criminal justice reform. We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We did the greatest—if you look at what we've done with Opportunity Zones, nobody has ever even thought of a plan like that. The President. Prior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country, and really doing terrible things all over the world—doing terrible things—we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American—almost every group was the best for unemployment. The unemployment numbers were the best. You look at—so you look at employment; you look at Opportunity Zones; and maybe most importantly of all, you look at criminal justice reform; you look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else—and I've said this, and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1244"
"8","The President's News Conference","
          Jul 23, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. The President. We've had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus. I have reminded people of the importance of masks when you can't socially distance, in particular. A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places. Yesterday we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents. We're working very hard on that. We're doing very well all over the country. And also about contracting with Pfizer—we made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they're very close—but we have a lot of companies that are very close—to produce a vaccine. And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you: This afternoon my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida. It's a place I love. And I love that State. The drawings look absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good, so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well—a tremendous list of speakers; thousands of people wanting to be there—and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there. They wanted to attend. People making travel arrangements all over the country; they wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line. But I looked at my team, and I said: ""The timing for this event is not right. It's just not right with what's happened recently—the flareup in Florida—to have a big convention. It's not the right time."" It's really something that, for me—I have to protect the American people. That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do. That's what I'm about. They said: ""Sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm. Incredible enthusiasm. Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they've seen. We can do this safely, and we can do it responsibly."" And I said, ""There's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that's from the China virus or the radical-left mob that you see in Portland""—where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days. They went in, and people were out of control for 51 days, a long time. And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in, and they've done a great job protecting our property—the Federal courthouse and other property—and, most importantly, protecting our people. Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit—a lot of other cities where so many people are shot, and so many people are killed. And people elected me to help and to protect. So I told my team, ""It's time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention."" We'll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, as has always been planned. We were never taking that off. That's remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That's where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina, and they'll be doing the nomination. And we're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online—the week that we're discussing, which will be really good. I think we're going to do it well. And I'll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country—and even in the world—who would be coming into the State, and I don't want to do anything to upset it. They'll be doing very well very shortly. We're going to put some maps up of the country behind me, and you'll see that the area that we're talking about is a hotspot. You will also see a lot of the country is—has no problem whatsoever—most of the country, actually. So I'm always going to take care of you, so that that's the way we're going to do it. I've spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community and its great mayor. He's a great, great guy. Really great guy. They wanted it so badly. And all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida. And just very special people, a very special group. And they were there for us, a hundred percent. Today I want to provide an update on the actions we're taking to support the safe reopening of America's schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they're essential to our children's future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high-risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen. It said, quote: ""Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in [a] social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical [and] sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of, in some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been [a] substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and [for] families."" So that's very important, and there's a highway—it goes both ways. The National Education Association recently stated, ""Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support."" Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important. One study estimates that, due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35-percent behind in reading compared to the typical year and more than 50-percent behind in math. That's a big statement. According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income Black and Hispanic students. They're the ones that are hit the hardest. We don't want that happening. Thirty million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools. According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly, having to do with child abuse, they have neglect—and these are neglect and neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So people in the education world, on the premises, will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children. They know if they've been neglected. They know if they've been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it's at home or someplace else. But they see this at school. And you don't get to see that if you're not going to school. It's a big thing. Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus, very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. Ninety-nine percent of all China virus hospitalizations are adults. And 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than 1 percent and even a small percentage of 1 percent. In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names. The life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and well-being of America's children. I have a very, very special person who loves children, who is, I think, one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say ""the greatest pitcher of all time."" Known as a ""relief pitcher"" who could have been whatever he wanted. Some people—he is the greatest reliever of all time, by far. Substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently. And he—I'm reading off these stats. I knew he was the best. I knew he was great, but I didn't know it was almost double anybody else. But he's a man who loves children—has children, loves children, works hard with children. We're going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera—you know, he's the ""Sandman,"" right? My wife said, ""Darling, why do they call him the 'Sandman'?"" I said: ""You know, they play the song. He just puts the batters to sleep."" And that's exactly what happened. So having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. He was talking about children in schools. And there's nobody that's done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man. Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and to protect students. And we do have to protect the teachers and the families also; we have to remember that. All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk. In cities or States that are current hotspots—and you'll see that in the map behind me—districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks, and that's possible. That will be up to Governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community, but every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So it's pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit. Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk—much lower, in the case of young children—to resume work and school and—as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that. A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don't want to do that. At the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday. Housing prices—pricing of housing up 21 percent. It's the highest in history. It's the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21 percent. Today the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and well-being of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn't about politics, this is about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it's bad politics if you do the wrong decision. Very bad politics. We're asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures, such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aides, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing, and crucially, mask-wearing. This money is in addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have; some is distributed, and some is not distributed. If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being ""choice."" If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we'd like the money to go to the parents of the student. This way, they can make the decision that's best for them. We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. That's a tremendous problem. It's a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open. More than a dozen European countries—as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others—have already reopened schools, and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense. We'll continue to support States and cities in the current hotspots in the South, Southwest, and West. The Governors, I know them all. They're all very, very capable. They're doing a very good job. They're working so hard. You wouldn't even believe it. We have nearly 30,000 Federal personnel deployed in the States that need assistance. We're helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds. As a PPE update, we're in close communication with Governors and States. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We're very strong on supplies. Remember I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite. Due to our historic efforts to increase both the National Stockpile and the State stockpiles, the vast majority of the States have 60 days' worth of supplies on hand. And most importantly, they have ventilators, because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we're making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them, in many cases, to other countries. For States that are making requests, we're rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000—well, let me change that. We've created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We'll go check that, and we'll give it you in a little while. But we've got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we've sent out about 600 just recently. The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world, by far. Roughly half of the tests are either the rapid, point-of-care tests, which, frankly, solves a lot of problem in delay, 5 to 15 minutes, instead of waiting for service both ways, in both directions, and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are 5- to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, in some cases, immediately. We're continuing to surge testing to current hotspots, such as Miami and Phoenix, to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. This is a copy of the map, and this is a—you have it right behind me. That's really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that, it's in great shape, lots of it. The Northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West—some problems. That will all work out. On therapies: We've worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of remdesivir are arriving this week. That's a lot. That's a really—that's a lot. They're working around the clock to make it. It's had a tremendous impact. We've also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past 2 weeks. Arizona is doing very well; it's heading down. Numbers are heading down, I think, very quickly. The Governor has done a great job. They've all done a great job. They've all done a great job. Working hard. We'll continue to monitor the areas rising and—with respect to cases. And we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China. It should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could have stopped it. They didn't. And the entire world has gotten infected, and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now. This morning I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they're going through a very hard time with this, in Moscow, in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia. They're doing well, but they're going through a lot. Everybody is going through a lot. Yesterday I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot. They're going through a hard time. This could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily. But for some reason, it wasn't, and we'll figure out what that reason was. So, with that, if you have any questions. Please. Cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida/National Economy  Cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida/National Economy  Q. On the convention, were you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention? Q.  The President. I just felt it was wrong, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], to have people going to what turned out to be a hotspot. You know, when we chose it, it was not at all hot; it was free. And all of a sudden, it happened quickly. It happens quickly. And it goes away, and it goes away quickly. The key is, we want it to go away without a lot of death, without a lot of problems. The President. And we're learning so much about the disease. That's why we're very cognizant of nursing homes—we're watching them very carefully—and people over a certain age, and especially people over a certain age with diabetes or heart disease, in particular—but with a problem. So we didn't want to take any chances. So we had a lot of people. We have—the delegates want to be there. We're going to do a fairly reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina. The nomination will be produced. And then, we'll announce what we're doing, how we're doing it, whether it's something that's done online; I guess you could call it ""online."" So there can nothing—there can be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention and in a great place, as you know. We had a great time—a great time—in Cleveland. But it's a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was, and I think we'll have that, including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive. I have to say, the stock market is close to records. For NASDAQ, it is a record. It's already exceeded its highest numbers. But we want to get our country back to what it was. Coronavirus Outbreak in China/China-U.S. Trade  Coronavirus Outbreak in China/China-U.S. Trade  Q. And so would your acceptance speech be from the White House? Are you worried that—— Q.  The President. We haven't set that yet, Steve . We'll have that—we'll probably announce that over the next few days. The President. Q. Are you worried this might dampen enthusiasm for you? Q.  The President. Look, we've done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. Nobody close, not China, not anybody. We had to close it, we saved millions of lives, then we opened it. But we had the best numbers in history for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, every group you want to name: young people without a diploma, young people with a high school diploma, with a college diploma. Anything you want to name, we had the best numbers. Women doing incredibly. Never been a time like that. The President. And we had to turn it off because of what China did. We had to turn it off. And then, all of the sudden, now we turn it back on, and we're doing very well. But it was very bad. China—speaking about China—the trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it. When I made it, it was a great deal. But they're setting records. Yesterday was a record corn day. They purchased more corn than any order ever, and that went on for 2 or 3 days. And soy beans and all. But it just means much less to me. Can you understand that? It just means much less to me. Please, go ahead. Cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida  Cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, Florida  Q. Thank you. What was the one thing—if there was one thing—that changed your mind about the convention? And did Florida officials ask you to cancel it? Q.  The President. No, they didn't. We're dealing with them, but they didn't. I would just say safety. Just safety. I just—you know, I could see the media saying: ""Oh this is very unsafe. This is""—I don't want to be in that position. It's safety—not because of the media, but that's what they would say. The President. And we'll have a very nice something; we'll figure it out. It will be online, in some form. Maybe it will be something even a little bit different. We have time. You know, we're talking about the end of August. But I think it will be something that will be exciting, but there can be nothing like having 25,000 people. We had a tremendous thing planned in—and a tremendous convention planned in North Carolina. And it would have been very good, but a much smaller version in Florida. But then, we saw what was happening. Pretty quickly, we saw that the virus was coming up that coast. Rise in Coronavirus Cases in Florida/School Reopening Efforts Q. Do you think it's an acknowledgment of the severity of the situation in Florida? Rise in Coronavirus Cases in Florida/School Reopening Efforts Q.  The President. No, I think it's going to come and go. It will. I mean, you take a look at—some of these locations were heavily infected. I mean, to a point where—Deborah and I were talking that—you know, when you look at what happened in New York and what happened in New Jersey and other places. And now you're looking, and it's gone. I hope it stays gone. I think we—I think it will. But we had to be—we have to be vigilant. We have to be careful. The President. And we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It's hard for us to say we're going to have a lot of people packed in a room, and then other people shouldn't do it. Don't forget, we're talking about schools. And we want them to be vigilant. And we're saying, ""Open."" And then, we're saying—here you have a big room. But I also—if you notice, I said, ""Where bars are crowded, where other things are crowded."" Well, there's nothing more crowded than a convention. A convention—I mean, you've seen them. And even though you try and keep people away from each other, it's just not that kind of a thing. They probably can't do that. It just doesn't work for them. So it's a very hard—so I think we're setting an example by doing it. It's very important. Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Coronavirus Testing Statistics  Coronavirus Testing Statistics  Q. Mr. President, if I can come back to school openings, you talked about money that Congress was looking at to help schools who want to reopen. If a school wants to reopen, but is concerned about testing, would you consider directing some of that money toward testing for either—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——a school district or even individual schools if that's what it took to open the schools? Q.  The President. Yes, I think so. I mean, I—a lot of people feel differently about testing. We talk about it a lot. When we have 50 million tests-plus, and you know, we broke the 50 million-test mark. The President. Second in the world is India, which has 1.4 billion people, and they had 12 million tests. And other countries that are very big had 2 million tests. And some countries essentially only test if you're sick and walk into a hospital or walk into a doctor's office or you're literally really sick. They essentially don't do tests unless you're sick, and I understand that too. So yes, if they feel that that's what they want, it's—that would be fine. Coronavirus Testing Access/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Coronavirus Testing Access/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Q. You would tell Congress—you would encourage Congress to pay for testing for school districts? Q.  The President. I would if they want. Again, we've done 50 million tests. There's nobody even close in the whole world. You look at our mortality rate. You look at our death rate. You look at different statistics. We're doing very well. But one death is too many. This should never have happened. This should never have been allowed to happen—from China. The President. Payroll Tax Cut Q. Also, Mitch McConnell's office just put out a statement, a moment ago, about the phase four relief package, CARES II, saying, quote, it's ""tailored precisely for this phase of the crisis."" Yet it does not include your payroll tax cut. So do you believe it's perfectly tailored? Payroll Tax Cut Q.  The President. Yes, I'd like to see a payroll tax cut. I think it's great for the workers. The Democrats would never have gone for it. They don't want it. They're not big into the workers, I guess. And based on that, I told them last night—I told the Republicans, who have been working very hard on this, I'll tell you—and they want what's right for the country—and hopefully, the Democrats ultimately will. The President. But I said, ""I think a payroll tax will be good, but you're not going to get it from the Democrats."" We need their votes, as you know. It's not like—you know, we have a majority, but it's not enough that we—that's why I guess we have an election coming up. So you still need Democrat votes, and we're not going to get the Democrat votes on that. So I'd like to see it. I think it would be very good for the workers. But if we're not going to get their votes, I guess we have to go on to the next thing. A payroll tax cut would have been very good. And maybe something happens. Yes, please. Resumption of Major League Baseball and Other Sporting Events  Resumption of Major League Baseball and Other Sporting Events  Q. You talk about setting an example on Jacksonville. But I just wonder: Some people are going to take away from this the lesson that you're pushing too far, too fast. It seemed, for a while, the numbers were going up in Jacksonville, and you were going to have a problem there. This comes up at a time you're pushing for schools to reopen, you have the opening of the Major League Baseball season. Isn't the example of Jacksonville that we're pushing too fast? Q.  The President. Well, baseball, as an example—we were discussing it a little while ago—you're going to be at an empty stadium. I've agreed—Randy Levine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees, and he asked me to throw out the first pitch, and I think I'm doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium. And I say, ""How's the crowd going to be?"" And you know, it's like you don't have a crowd; there is no such thing. The President. It's going to be interesting, Mariano. He's not used to that. I've been at many games. He walks in; the place goes crazy. I think it'd be just as good without the crowd. You were just born with it, you know. Some people are born with it. I don't know if—this is only for the baseball players, but I've never seen a pitcher throw a ball where so many bats were broken as Mariano. He's got the alltime record. I said, ""How do you do that?"" He said, ""Parents."" Great parents, when you get right down to it. Right? ""How do you do that?"" It's called parents. Q. [Inaudible]—baseball, but the question—— Q.  Inaudible The President. But—but—— The President. Q. ——the question really is—— Q.  The President. Yes, I just—just to finish, I think—I think that we have to all set examples. I think Major League Baseball is setting the example by, you know, playing to empty stadiums, and so are other sports. You see that. Now, then they'll allow a certain number in. I see golf is now—soon will be allowing people to come in, in percentages. And all of a sudden, we want to get back to normal. The key is to get back to normal, because nobody wants to see this. But I think it's really good that baseball is opening. It looks like football is opening. It looks like sports are opening. We have—it's a tremendous thing, psychologically, for our country. The President. And we're all, whether we're see—we're going to see right now some beautiful, young Little Leaguers outside with a great future ahead of them. They're already practicing on the front lawn of the White House, and we're going to go out and say hello to them, and it'll be really great. Okay, how about one more? Yes, please. Go ahead. Republican Coronavirus Relief Legislation/Federal Bureau of Investigations Headquarters Renovation  Republican Coronavirus Relief Legislation/Federal Bureau of Investigations Headquarters Renovation  Q. President Trump, the Washington Post, earlier today, reported that one thing holding up the GOP coronavirus bill is the White House asking that it include language regarding the FBI building in downtown Washington, DC. Is that true? Q.  The President. I don't know that they're putting it in this bill, but I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old, and it's really—it was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And it's got a lot of danger involved and panels falling off the outside and pieces of concrete falling off the building. The President. And they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to him, ""Frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department."" There's nothing better than the site. The site they have now is better. But they were looking in sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would have been too far away. So I am—I've been encouraging them to build it. And if you're going to—you have a choice: You can renovate the existing building—but it's not a good building—or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years and have it be incredible. Even with tracks on top, they're talking about—you know, we have—because FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter-mile tracks on top. It's a very big site, a very wide site. So I think the idea—the best idea would be to build a new building. And that way, you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else. But the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Q. Mr. President, why do you think—[inaudible]—is overrated?

"9","The President's News Conference on COVID-19 Vaccine Development at the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Bioprocess Innovation Center in Morrisville, North Carolina","
          Jul 27, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Great to be in this wonderful State. So many friends, so much success, and we love being here. And we're here, actually, today to discuss the exciting progress that we've achieved under the Operation Warp Speed, our historic initiative to develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a vaccine in record time. And that's what it is, in record time. Likewise, therapeutically, we are very, very advanced. You're hearing about it, and you'll be hearing about it a lot more in the next 2 weeks. We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing America's scientific genius, which is what it is. The President. I'm therefore proud to announce that this morning, the Moderna vaccine has officially entered phase three already. And that's phase three clinical trials: the final stage before approval. There's never been anything like this, in terms of speed, nothing even close. A second vaccine is likely to enter phase three in a matter of days. Under Operation Warp Speed, we've shaved years off of the time that it takes to develop a vaccine—in some cases, many years—and we've done it while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety. This is the fastest a vaccine for a novel pathogen has ever gone. It has never gone like this. And if you look at where we are, by phase three, we could say ""ever gone by far."" Four additional promising candidates are expected to enter final trials in the coming weeks, including the Novavax vaccine being developed right here at this facility. It's an incredible facility. We're going to be making a tour in a little while—a very, very complete tour—with the folks that run it and the people that operate. We've just completed a tour of Fujifilm's innovation laboratories—and that's going to be done at a much, much higher level in a few minutes after I'm finished, and I believe we'll take a few questions too—which were carrying out a crucial biomanufacturing process needed to make the Novavax vaccine. This production is made possible by my administration's $1.6 billion award to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed. It lets us deliver the final product in a time that never has been achieved anywhere, at any time, for anything like this. These same manufacturing processes are being conducted on an even larger scale in College Station, Texas. Today I'm proud to announce that HHS has just signed a $265 million contract with the Fujifilm Texas A&M Innovation Center, which is quite the place, to dramatically expand their vaccine manufacturing capacity. I want to thank Fujifilm CEO Martin Meeson for welcoming us today. And Martin—where is, Martin? Thank you. Thank you very much, Martin. It's really wonderful to be with you under these circumstances in particular, with all the progress that's being made. As well as Novavax CEO Stanley Erck—Stanley, thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here. Thanks also to Secretary Alex Azar, who is with us; Senator Thom Tillis, thank you very much. Thank you, Thom. Stand up, Thom. Good job you've done. Thank you very much. You really have. Representatives Richard Hudson, David Rouzer, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Greg Murphy, thank you. All friends. All warriors. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who I hear is doing a great job—where is Dan? Stand up, Dan. Great job, Dan. Really good. North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore—thank you, Tim. Great job. And President pro tem of the North Carolina State Senate, Phil Berger. Thank you, Phil, very much. I appreciate it. Operation Warp Speed is funding a historic portfolio of highly promising vaccine candidates. In addition to our $1.6 billion investment in Novavax, we've issued a $483 million contract with Moderna, a $1.2 billion contract with AstraZeneca, a $465 million contract with Janssen, and just last week, a $1.95 billion agreement with Pfizer. Tremendous progress is being made with all of those great companies. Our groundbreaking agreement with Pfizer includes a guarantee to deliver 100 million doses shortly after the vaccine's approval—almost immediately—with the option to purchase an additional 500 million thereafter. Not only is Operation Warp Speed accelerating the development of a vaccine, we're also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing has happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously. So everything goes at one time. We're not waiting and waiting and waiting; it's all going at one time. We have a system that has—I think it's unparalleled. Never been done before, but we suspect it's going to work and work very well. We're mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that it's approved, it will be available to the American people immediately. And we'll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world. The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus. Over 140 clinical trials are underway, and a number of effective therapies have already been developed and widely delivered, including remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact—you see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically—dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and antibody treatments. We have numerous treatments right now that are under study, and I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. Late stage. Due to the medical advances we've already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85-percent lower than it was in April—think of that: 85 percent—and is 25-percent lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22 percent of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down—as of last week, it's dropped down to under 7 percent. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing—very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They're pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than—substantially more than 50 percent. Last week, our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began distributing rapid point-of-care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes. What we've already sent includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point-of-care tests. It's a tremendous amount. That's—you'll get your response and answer from 5 to 15 minutes. Over the next 3 weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point-of-care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That's more than all of Europe put together, times two. Nobody is even close. And as countries go, it is—as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. And we're going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, we've completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we've now distributed nearly 100 million N95 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face shields, and much, much more. In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month, and we're distributing—we have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need. Other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves, and 6 million gowns. It's a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas, and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona, they're heading very substantially down, and rapidly. We've been constant—and in constant communication with the States and are surging them resources when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full, we have everything we need, we get it to the States immediately, we deal with the Governors. The relationship with the Governors has been very good. These States are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner and very, very quickly. We are working with every Governor and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each State, as well as tailored recommendations. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections, by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America, however, the region's reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted. And I can say that's probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases; most of the world doesn't. They either don't do testing—therefore, they have very few cases, even though people are sick—or they just don't report it. Given the reality of what we just said, we're focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly infected countries outside of our borders. I've spoken with Governor Abbott—terrific gentleman—and I can report that over 3,300 Federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We've given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We've supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators, and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals will receive 500 cases of remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross-border spread, this stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease. We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially—especially—focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars, and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk, which are, in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them, and you want to guard them, and you want to protect them from the virus especially—especially those that are really targeted—almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic, pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time. As our visit here demonstrates—and I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great State of North Carolina. This is a great place. It's a phenomenal place. And we've had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive and to—the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I'm there, when they call—most of them, many of them are sitting here right now—I will always answer their call. So thank you very much. I appreciate your being here with us. And let's get on to a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made, and it's been made rapidly, and it's been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. So please. Thank you very much. Thank you. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Q. The President. Thank you. The President.  Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. There's been a lot of despair when it comes to the virus. Is today's event about giving Americans hope, a sense of optimism? Is that what you're trying to do? Q.  The President. Well, I think so. But you know, there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren't doing so well. The President. We're—you know, before—just before I left the White House, in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they're making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you, therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we'll have some, really, very good things to say. We're just having great answers. So it is about that, and it's also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length is just coming along really well. And it's not just one company, it's many companies have had tremendous progress. So that will be announced over the next very short period. Q. When is the soonest you expect a vaccine to be ready for Americans to take? Q.  The President. Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we're in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we're going to—in terms of the vaccine. I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning, you go, and you give somebody, whether it's transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal, and they heal quickly. The President. So we've had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at remdesivir and if you look at some of the other things. But we'll have some announcements on that over the next 2 weeks. Yes, it is hope, but it's only hope, because we've gotten such incredible results, scientifically. President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia  President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia  Q. And one final question, sir. The President. Yes. Q.  The President Q. You did talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And I wanted to ask if you did bring up the reports of Russia having bounties on our soldiers in Afghanistan. Q.  The President. We don't talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion, and I think it was very productive. The President. Please. National Economy/Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  National Economy/Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Larry Kudlow, earlier today, said that the V-shaped recovery is showing signs of moderating. Do you think, given what we're seeing with the increase in cases, that the recovery could be in jeopardy at all, the economic recovery? Q.  The President. I don't think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We've set record job numbers. We've set record numbers. Whether it's a pure ""V"" or a little bit less than that, I think it's going to be very good. The President. If, therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you're going to have a tremendous recovery. Likewise, with the vaccines, if you do that by the end of the year, that's ahead of schedule—substantially ahead of schedule. And it's ahead of anything that's ever taken place, in terms of vaccines, before. So I think if those things happen—if just one of those events happen, you'll go right back into that ""V,"" and I think you're probably in the ""V"" anyway. I really do believe a lot of the Governors should be opening up States that they're not opening, and we'll see what happens with them. But a lot will have to do with the fact that, therapeutically, I think you're going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yes, please. Go ahead, in the back. Q. Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you about—— Q 2020 Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina  2020 Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina  Q. Zachery Eanes from the Raleigh News & Observer. Now that you've canceled the Jacksonville portion of the RNC, do you think Governor Cooper made the right choice in limiting attendance in Charlotte? Q.  The President. Well, we're actually coming to North Carolina, as you know. And we're having a very major—I guess that would be the nomination night, so that's Monday. That will be Monday—they're going to be here. And the rest we'll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing. And I'm really happy that we're going to be having a piece of it at least—and a very important piece—in North Carolina. The President. Yes, please. Go ahead. 2020 Presidential Election/National Economy/Federal Coronavirus Response  2020 Presidential Election/National Economy/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Mr. President, your poll numbers suffered in recent months because of your handling on the pandemic. You're here now today. What's your plan, going forward, to prove to Americans that you're the right person for this job? Q.  The President. I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We're leading in North Carolina. We're leading in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Arizona—our numbers. We're leading in Arizona. We're leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We're leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it's a terrible thing when you look at it. The President. But I had the same thing 4 years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn't going to win any State, and I ended up winning every one of them, you know, the swing States. I wasn't going to win any of them, and I won all of them. And I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer. They have it closer, but it's the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing State and substantially in other States, by even more than I won in '16. When you look at Florida, as an example, you have thousands of boat out on—boats out in the ocean, out in the Intracoastal. You look at other States where, likewise, you have thousands of boats, and they're all waving the Trump sign—Trump-Pence sign—and they're so proud. Thousands and thousands. You've seen it—where you have Bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there's more spirit now than there's ever been for my campaign, and that includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there's more today, because what we've done, nobody has ever done before. Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes—the most in our history—created the greatest economy we've ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody has ever done, and all of these different things. The VA—we got VA Choice. We got VA everything for the VA. Right now they had a 91-percent approval rating at—in a recent poll. I was just speaking to the Secretary—91 percent in the VA. That's never happened before. I think when people see all that we've done, even Space Force. We created a force, an actual—you know, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Right? It's pretty amazing. Coast Guard. And now Space Force. That hasn't happened in 75 years. What we've done—working with some of those warriors over there, by the way—but what we've done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, one of the—perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton—everybody wanted to get it done; I got it done—ANWR in Alaska. Probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. No, what we've done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic, and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. And by the way, gasoline prices for everyone are very, very low, in many cases, less than $2. That's pretty incredible. And I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone, and they cut way back. And we're now at $40-and-plus a barrel. And we're saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We're the number-one in energy in the world. So with all that we've done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history. We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again. And everyone knows I'm going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn't close it, you would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more, than that—what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever—far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs—they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they've had—think of it—in 67 years. We were having the best year we've ever had. I had to close it, and now we're reopening it. And next year, we'll be stronger. It will be the strongest year so far. It will be better, even than last year. Okay, thank you very much. I'll be heading back, and I'll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We're going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders. Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you. Q.

"10","The President's News Conference","
          Jul 28, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Today my administration has taken a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence—a very, very big, big step—a focus of our campaign to bring America's critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the U.S.A. We've been working on this for a long time. The President. This is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus. It should have never happened. It should have never been here. They should have stopped it. In the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States. Millions of jobs were vacuumed out, just taken out so easily. Our politicians let that happen. And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world—countries all over the world. Nearly 4 years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home where they belong. When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security. We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America's medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs. I just want to say that Pfizer just announced, a little while ago, that they're combining phase two and phase three trials, and the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, in a very positive direction. First time that's happened. And they're many months ahead of any other trial. There's never been anything like it. So it's the fastest ever, and to me, it's very exciting. Today I'm proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries. My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company—you remember this company; it's called—from the good, old camera age, the old days—to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. It's called Kodak. And it's going to be right here in America. So I want to congratulate the people in Kodak. They've been working very hard. Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now—Rochester, New York—good place. And they're trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal. I want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives. We've worked really well together on this deal. It's a big deal. It's going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak. Ninety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs. We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration, by far. Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less. Yet, in less than 10 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs—they're currently manufactured in America—more than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China. And you'll be seeing—a lot of things have happened. It's been happening, but it's happening at a more rapid pace right now. With this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals. It's a great name, when you think of it. Such a great name. It was one of the great brands in the world. Then, people went digital, and Kodak didn't follow. But now, under very extraordinary leadership, they are following, and they're doing something that's a different field, and it's a field that they've really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company—watching over it. But it's a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States. Under this contract, our 33d use of the Defense Production Act—remember when you were saying I didn't use it enough, I didn't use it enough? And now you heard it's the 33d use. We don't talk about it all the time; we used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren't doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage. But this is our 33d use of the Defense Production Act. Kodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal. Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe. We'll be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries. Once this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we've opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the U.S.A. That's a big number: 25 percent. This agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak's factory in Rochester; that's just in the initial phase. And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well, and it's a great place—and I'm very happy that we're able to help them with the problems that they've had recently. And the National Guard—I want to thank the National Guard, both State and beyond. I want to thank them for the incredible job. They went in, and they did some beautiful job. They cleaned it up. You didn't hear about the problems anymore. And indirectly, I want to create—we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains. We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain—not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also. I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible. Today's action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history. We'll be able to do that. Through the Defense Production Act and other authorities, we have invested more than $3 billion in our Nation's industrial base. We've contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year, nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year. We've contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase U.S. production of N95 masks. And we've brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we'll have 160 million in a very short while, 160 million a month. That's many times what we used to do. If you go back 2 years ago, it's many, many times. We're increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent. It's 1,000 percent. We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year. We're finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric. We have 13 million reusable gowns in the stockpile, and we'll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed. We made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests. So we have—there's nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max. And we're already at about a 50-percent level, and we're bringing it up very substantially from there. We're growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month. There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close. Through our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing in the State of Maine—a great State—we've increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now. As you remember, I went to Maine; I went to the plant where they do this. It was incredible. It was a great experience. And we'll produce over 100 million swabs per month by January. We've dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we'll have 500 million doses. And logistically, we're using our military, our great military—a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations—and they'll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They're all mobilized. It's been fully set up. A very, very talented general is in charge. And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It will be a very rapid process all over the country. And perhaps we'll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we, all of a sudden, have become very good at making. When the China virus struck our Nation, we mobilized the entire Government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies. HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns. That's a lot of gowns. Last week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States. Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens. As you know, that's where we want to take care—we have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem—in particular, heart or diabetes. Which provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns. We have replenished the long-neglected National Stockpile. In January, the stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks. Today, the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we'll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number. We've shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we've more than 75,000 available to deploy. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. And if you remember, early on, when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by, and now we're the largest maker anywhere in the world, by far. And not only are we fully supplied and stocked, but we're helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get. This is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history. We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world's premier medical manufacturer and supplier. That's what's happening already. It's been happening now for quite some time. We're seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country; it's corona-free. But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It's starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you'll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it's starting to head down. In the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what's been going on. And we, as you know, have done a excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse where they wanted to burn it down. They're anarchists. Nothing short of anarchists, agitators. And we have protected it very powerfully. And if we didn't go there, I will tell you, you wouldn't have a courthouse. You'd have a billion-dollar burned-out building. We're also working aggressively to combat the virus and Native American and Alaska Native communities. Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in Tribal communities, and we've worked very hard with Tribal communities. They're very vulnerable to this horrible plague. That's the largest investment in Indian Country in U.S. history. There's never been an investment that big in Indian Country. We need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease. It's critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk—and, in fact, some are in—some age groups are at an extraordinary low risk themselves—they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk. I ask all Americans, regardless of background or age, to practice social distancing, which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it; remain vigilant about hygiene; avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars; and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate. Through the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We're looking at a very powerful year next year, economically. The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly; set records. The numbers on retail—retail sales—came in 2 weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country. So we look like we're heading to some very, very good economic times; that means jobs, that means stock market. The stock market is already doing very well. It's getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this—when we were hit with the plague. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please. Go ahead. 2020 Republican National Convention Location  2020 Republican National Convention Location  Q. Can you clarify: Your acceptance speech for the Republican nomination, are you physically going to be in Charlotte, or will you give the speech here or somewhere else? Q.  The President. We'll be doing a speech on Thursday—the main speech, the primary speech. Charlotte—they will be doing—nominating on Monday. That's a different period, a different thing happening, but they'll be doing nominations on Monday. I speak on Thursday. Okay? The President. Q. From where? Q.  The President. We'll go—we'll be announcing it soon. We'll be announcing it soon. Q. So you could be going to Charlotte? The President. Q.  The President. Anybody have any ideas? We'll be announcing it very soon. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Yes, please, go ahead. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q. Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, the negotiations are ongoing right now for the next relief measures. Republicans—Senate Republicans have put forth their plan. Do you support what Senate Republicans have put forward? And are there certain aspects that they've put forward that you don't support? Q.  The President. Yes, there are actually, and we'll be talking about it. There are, you know, also things that I very much support, but we'll be negotiating. It's sort of semi-irrelevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks, and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved. Kevin has been very active, as you know—all of the people involved. Steve Mnuchin has done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican. The President. And we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things. All right? Q. What do you think of what Senate Republicans put forward, sir? What do you make of what Senate Republicans put forward? Q.  Potential Alternative Treatments for Coronavirus/Hydroxychloroquine  Potential Alternative Treatments for Coronavirus/Hydroxychloroquine  Q. Mr. President, two questions quickly. First, can you clarify your position on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine after you retweeted a video making claims that it is effective? Q.  The President. Well, that was—I wasn't making claims. The—it's recommendations of many other peoples and—people, including doctors. Many doctors think it is extremely successful—the hydroxychloroquine—coupled with the zinc and perhaps the azithromycin. But many doctors think it's extremely good, and some people don't. Some people—I think it's become very political. The President. I happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here. Right? I'm here. I happen to think it's—it works in the early stages. I think frontline medical people believe that too—some, many. And so we'll take a look at it. But the one thing we know: It's been out for a long time, that particular formula, and that's what—essentially, what it is, the pill. And it's been for malaria, lupus, and other things. It's safe. It doesn't cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem, felt no different. Didn't feel good, bad, or indifferent. I—and I tested, as you know. It didn't get me, and it's not going to, hopefully, hurt anybody. So we know from that standpoint—because it's been so many years, from a safety standpoint, it's safe. I happen to think, based on what I've read—I've read a lot about hydroxy. I happen to think that it has an impact, especially at the early years. There were some very good tests at Ford, and the doctor from Yale came up with a very, very strong testament to it. There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the internet, and for some reason, the internet wanted to take them down and took them off. I guess Twitter took them off and I think Facebook took them off. I don't know why. I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it, that she's had tremendous success with it. And they took her—— Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible The President. ——they took her voice off. I don't know why they took her off, but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason, maybe they didn't. I don't know. The President.  I can only say that, from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. And I don't think you lose anything by doing it other than, politically, it doesn't seem to be too popular. You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say, ""Don't use it."" John [John Roberts, Fox News], please. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/Federal Coronavirus Response  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. On that note, Mr. President, last night, in tweets that were deleted by Twitter, you said that Dr. Fauci misled the country about hydroxychloroquine. How so? Q.  The President. No, not at all. I think—I don't even know what his stance is on it. I was just—you know, he was at the—he was at the Task Force meeting a little while ago. The President. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. You know, it's sort of interesting—we've listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven't always agreed with him, and it's, I think, pretty standard. That's okay. He did not want us to ban our—this—this—put up the ban to China, when China was heavily infected—very badly, Wuhan. He didn't want to do that, and I did. And other things. And he told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but it's—you know, I think it's fact that I banned—I did the ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he's said. So—you know, it's interesting: He's got a very good approval rating, and I like that. I—it's good. Because remember, he's working for this administration. He's working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr. Fauci. He's working with our administration. And, for the most part, we've done pretty much what he and others—Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific—recommended. And he's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect—and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we've done in terms of—we're just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I'd love to show you—perhaps you've seen it—where we're up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that's just a tiny fraction of what we've done, in terms of testing. So it sort of is curious: A man works for us—with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of. And yet they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all. Go ahead. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program/Immigration Reform/Executive Action on Prescription Drug Pricing  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program/Immigration Reform/Executive Action on Prescription Drug Pricing  Q. Can I just ask you also: DHS announced today that it is going to undertake a thorough review of the DACA program to decide whether to continue it, and if not, how to disband it. You had mentioned, after the Supreme Court ruling about DACA, that you were thinking about a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. Are you still thinking about that? Q.  The President. We're going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we're also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I've wanted for a long time. The President. That decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President, as a President, more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a health care bill and some other bills. And you've seen some of them come along. We're going to do tremendous—we just signed it 3 days ago—we're doing tremendous prescription drug price reductions. Tremendous. It could be over 50 percent—whether it's favored nations clauses or anything else. I mean, it's tremendous numbers we're talking about. You know, you go to some countries, and they'll sell, like, a pill for 10 cents, and in the United States, it costs $2. And it's the same basic factory. It's the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. Not going to happen with me. It's not going to happen with me. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. So, John, I think one of the exciting things—got very little coverage, and that's okay, but the people understand it—I think we will be reducing prescription drug prices by massive amounts, numbers that have never been done before. The President.  Other thing: In 51 years, we got—as you know, last year, drug prices came down. First time in 51 years that they came down. Now, with what I signed last week, I think that drug prices can come down by numbers like 50 percent and even greater, in certain instances. Q. But if I could come back to where I originally started, are you still considering a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients? Q.  The President. We are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we're also going to end up with a fantastic merit-based immigration system. The President. Please. Prescription Drug Cost Control Efforts  Prescription Drug Cost Control Efforts  Q. Yes. On the drug pricing, you had said that pharmaceutical representatives would be here today for a meeting to talk about bringing drug prices down or to negotiate. That meeting was cancelled. Why? Q.  The President. I didn't know a meeting was cancel—oh, a meeting with the drug—— The President. Q. You said there would be a meeting today with drug companies. Q.  The President. Well, I said there would be a meeting—yes, a meeting sometime this week. Yes. They want to meet. I mean, I don't know that it was canceled. They want to meet. I thought the meeting was actually scheduled for tomorrow. The President. Q. We will see, I guess. [Laughter] Q.  Laughter The President. I thought—I thought the meeting was scheduled tomorrow. Sorry about the dates. But you know, I see how upset you are by it. The President. Q. On the FBI headquarters, sir—— The President. Go ahead. Please. Bloomberg. Q.  The President. Q. On the FBI headquarters—— Q.  The President. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg. You look like Mr. Bloomberg. Go ahead. The President. Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Do you support—— Q.  The President. I think you look much better, actually. The President. Q. ——a temporary extension of supplemental unemployment aid if the deal that they're hashing out in Congress isn't completed by the end of this week? Those benefits are set to run out. Q.  The President. We'll do something. We're going to take care of the people. Yes. It's a good question. We're going to take care of the people. The President. Potential Alternative Treatments for Coronavirus/Hydroxychloroquine  Potential Alternative Treatments for Coronavirus/Hydroxychloroquine  Q. Mr. President, the woman that you said is a great doctor in that video that you retweeted last night said masks don't work and there is a cure for COVID-19, both of which health experts say is not true. She's also made videos saying that doctors make medicine using DNA from aliens, and that they're trying to create a vaccine to make you immune from becoming religious. Q.  The President. Well, maybe it's a saying, maybe it's not. The President. Q. So what's the logic in retweeting that? Q.  The President. But I can—I can tell you this: She was on air, along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that, from where she came—— The President. Q. It's misinformation. Q.  The President.——I don't know which country she comes from, but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her. The President. Q. But she said masks don't work. And last week, you said masks—— Q.  Yes, go ahead. Paula [Paula Reid, CBS News]. Q. Last week—— Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. Well, real quick. Last week, you said masks—— Q.  The President. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. The President.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1246"
"11","The President's News Conference","
          Jul 30, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well. And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus. And we send our prayers to Herman's great wife Gloria. Wonderful family. The President. And I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy. We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people, as people that love one another. And we're working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague—it's what it is, is a plague—but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines. And we're making a lot of strides. All over the world, they're having tremendous problems. A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet—in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong—places where they thought it was—they had really done great. It came back. And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly. The virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes, you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement. Since the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times—that's 35 times—in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised. Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections. And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers—you have no idea what they might be. And I can say ""scarcity of testing."" Almost anywhere, except for our country. This disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border States. Meanwhile, States like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others, they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard. And Governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore. They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and—now, I'm not even saying this is their fault. It's probably not their fault. It's just the way it is. That's the way it is. Highly infectious, one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen. Not since 1917, over a hundred years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we're witnessing now. But these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound. And, again, no one is immune. No one is immune. These facts illustrate the imposing determinant—and it is a determinant—that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country. People are starting to understand the disease now. We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn't have any idea. We didn't—nobody ever saw anything like this. The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality. And we've done that. But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it. We did the right thing initially. We saved millions of lives, what we did. We did the right thing. But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all. A small shutdown of certain areas—but we don't want to do that—small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. We understand what we're dealing with now, but it's a very complex situation. And I can only say, thank Heaven that we are so advanced in what we're doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies. We now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets. Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population. Think of it: Half of the deaths—really, a tremendous number—half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population: those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The average age of those who die from the illness is 78. We've announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable. The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions. I'm once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who's elderly, especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses. Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we're discussing. But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene. Everyone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease. The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected. In the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs. Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold. For every person with the virus, we're now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected. And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially. They're starting to come down in Florida. Arizona is really leading away. I was in Texas yesterday, and they're starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas. Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they're coming down very significantly. Earlier today I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy—which is a tremendous—a tremendous thing that they're looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it—potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease. More than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we're asking them to visit coronavirus.gov—coronavirus.gov—and volunteer to donate plasma. We need plasma. It's something that's been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do. Most people do. Plasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating. We've secured over 90 percent of the world's supply of remdesivir—which is terrific—an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. We've also approved the use of the widely-available steroid—which has been very successful—dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. On July 17, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials, moving along very rapidly. That's Regeneron. As a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85-percent lower than it was just in April. So in a very short period of time. Think of that: Just 18—85-percent lower than it was in April. It's a big statement. Now I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill. Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers. We love our American workers. And we've set records on job creation—records—2 months in a row. We enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs. We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans. We approved $500 billion for our hardest hit industries—$500 billion. We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties. It was a big thing, a very big thing. We also suspended student loan payments for 6 months, and we're looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time. As a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the 2 months past alone. To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will—we had a great foundation to build on. We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close. We were outdoing everybody from China. If you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States. Well, it didn't. We gained on them very significantly. We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen—2019, and we'll be back there very shortly. And it won't take very long, based on everything that we're seeing. It's not going to take very long. I think next year is going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint. We can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will. We'll never forget them; never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China. They should have stopped it, and they didn't. But I'm asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need. First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits. This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own. This was not anybody's fault. From the standpoint of jobs, it happened—a terrible thing happened. Could have been stopped. It happened. I want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today—in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I'm surprised at—because this is great for our country, and it's great for our workers, and it wasn't our workers' fault. Second, we're asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions. We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments. We don't want that to happen. Third, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program. This money will help millions of hard-working families get by. My administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen. Children are not [Children are]* at the lowest risk. If you look at what's going on: the younger, the better. Amazing—the immune system. For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself. I tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying—sadly, dying—the Governor was telling me that only one—Phil Murphy—only one died under the age of 18. That's incredible. Where thousands of people that died in the State of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18. Children are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus. Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our Nation's children. We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family. We have to remember that there's another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also. Economic harm, but it's causing death for different reasons. But death—probably more death. If Governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. So we say if a school doesn't want to open or if a Governor doesn't want to open—maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on—the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters, about their children. But to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party. They have tremendous voices. They're looking at November 3. And probably a day later, they'll say, ""Let's open up the country."" But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it's going right now. We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of States that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they're actually coming back very strong. This pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first. I got elected on the fact that I put America first. For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last. If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we've watched for many years destroy our country—NAFTA, we terminated it. We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic. But we put America first, America's families first, and America's workers first. But that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future. We've cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations. And we've cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country. Americans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before. So I just want to thank you all. And if you'd like, we'll take a few questions. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please. 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks  2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks  Q. Are you going to launch an effort to try to delay the election? Or was that just a trial balloon this morning? The President. Well, what I want to explain to people, but it doesn't need much explanation—I mean, you look at article after article: ""New York's Mail-Vote Disaster,"" ""Tens of thousands of mail ballots have been tossed out in this year's primaries. What will happen in November?"" It's a mess. This is done by Washington Post. Can you believe it? The Washington Post, of all papers. Fake news, but in this case, it's not fake, it's true. Q.  The President. This is done by the Wall Street Journal. Here's another one, ""Vote-by-mail experiment reveals potential problems within postal voting system ahead in the November election."" And you see what's happening with so many different places. They're doing even trial runs; they're a disaster. And I don't want to see an election—you know, so many years, I've been watching elections. And they say the ""projected winner"" or the ""winner of the election""—I don't want to see that take place in a week after November 3 or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election. You're sending out hundreds of millions of universal, mail-in ballots—hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to? It's common sense; you don't have to know anything about politics. And the Democrats know this. The Democrats know this, Steve. So I want to see—I want an election and a result much, much more than you. I think we're doing very well. We have the same fake polls, but we have real polls. We're doing very well. I just left Texas. And Biden came out against fracking. Well, that means Texas is going to be one of the most unemployed States in our country. That means Oklahoma, North Dakota, New Mexico are going to be a disaster. Ohio, Pennsylvania—disaster. No fracking. I want to have the result of the election. I don't want to be waiting around for weeks and months. And literally, potentially—if you really did it right—years, because you'll never know. These ballots are missing. You saw Paterson, New Jersey. You saw many other instances. There's tremendous litigation on that right now. And that doesn't include absentee. Absentee is different. Absentee, you have to work and you have to send in for applications. You have to go through a whole procedure. Like, for instance, I'm an absentee voter because I can't be in Florida because I'm in Washington; I'm at the White House. So I'll be an absentee voter. We have a lot of absentee voters, and it works. So we're in favor of absentee, but it's much different than millions of people. In California, they're going to send out tens of millions of voting forms. Well, where are they going to go? You read where postmen are in big trouble now. You read where city councils are in big trouble now. Voter fraud, all over the ballots. So no, I want to get—I want to be standing, hopefully, hand held high, big victory, because we're doing things with our country that I think nobody else could have done. Our country is—despite this pandemic, which is devastating the rest of the world, by the way—devastating. One of the articles that came out was, ""The World's COVID Resurgence."" This is the Wall Street Journal editorial, the main editorial yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. I don't always agree with them. But they have ""The World's COVID Resurgence."" ""Countries hailed as models to see""—and then they go, the virus returns at a level it's never—they haven't even seen. We've been giving praise to certain countries, and the virus has now come to them like the first time. But it's a very interesting—and it talks about many countries where everybody was holding them up and saying what a great job they did. Well, it's just one of those things. Didn't work out so well. So we want to have an election. I'd love to see voter ID, but this is the opposite of voter ID. The Democrats love it; the Republicans hate it. We all agree that absentee voting is good. Mail-in ballots will lead to the greatest fraud. You know, we talk about ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" for 2½ years, and then they found nothing, and there was nothing. But they talk ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They talk China. They talk all of these countries. They say they get involved in our elections. This is easy. You can forge ballots. This is much easier for foreign countries. Go ahead, Steve. Q. But delaying the election is probably a nonstarter. I mean, wouldn't you agree with that? Q.  The President. I just feel—I don't want a delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That's what's going to happen, Steve. That's common sense, and everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don't want to talk about it, but they know it. The President. And no, we want to have an election where people actually go in and—""What's your name?"" ""My name is so-and-so."" Boom, you sign the book, like I've been doing for years. It's very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn't work. How many ballots is he sending in California, as an example? Twenty-eight million or some massive number? Other States are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they've done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting. And look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting; it's a disaster. I'm very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story is a disaster. So we're asking for a lot of trouble. And no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens. John [John Roberts, Fox News]. 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies  2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies  Q. So, Mr. President, you said that you don't want to see a delay in the election, but then it looks like the process of these mail-in ballots is going to continue to November the 3rd. Q.  The President. Well, we have many court cases, John. We have one that's been filed for a while now in Western Pennsylvania, as an example, on mail-in ballots. The President. Q. So I'm just wondering, is—— Q.  The President. And by the way, John, we give tremendous examples, numbers of examples of all the fraud and all of the things that have taken place with respect to mail-in ballots. The President. Q. I'm just wondering, is the net effect of what you tweeted this morning and what you're talking about now to cast doubt on the results of the November 3 election? Q.  The President. Well, it's had an interesting impact. I didn't know it was going to be the impact it had. What people are now looking at is: Am I right? But not me. Are all these stories right about the fact that these elections will be fraudulent, they'll be fixed, they'll be rigged? And everyone is looking at it, and a lot of people are saying, ""You know, that probably will happen."" The President. Please, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News]. Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, to break the logjam in Congress and to prevent that unemployment insurance from lapsing, what do you plan to put on the table tonight? What are you planning—— Q.  The President. Well, it's a great question. I can't tell you, though, because that wouldn't be very smart from a negotiating standpoint. But we'll be putting certain things on the table. The President. Q. Do you have a plan to put something on the table? Q.  The President. We want to get money to people. It wasn't their fault. And we want to get money to people, and it has to be substantial. It's not their fault what happened. The President. The fact is, people don't like saying it—they know it's true—it's China's fault. Okay? It's not their fault. It's not the worker who lost his job; it's China's fault. And that's the way it is. OAN, please. Protests and Civil Unrest in Portland, Oregon/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Protests and Civil Unrest in Portland, Oregon/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday DHS came to an agreement with the Governor of Oregon to remove Federal officers, and Oregon State troopers took over. Mayor Ted Wheeler was noticeably absent from that agreement. Are you confident, sir, that the State of Oregon will be able to quell the protests in Portland? And if the violence does continue, would you consider redeploying Federal troops? Q.  The President. So our people have done—Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess. The President. They went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings—right?—like courthouses. The Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency—which I consider now to be an emergency—it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement. Yesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it—and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, ""I think Trump wants to take over the country."" It's crazy. So what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters—and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city. If they don't do it, we'll be sending in the National Guard. Please. School Reopening Efforts  School Reopening Efforts  Q. Mr. Trump, given what's happening with Major League Baseball and now, today, the Rutgers football team is quarantined, how can you assure people that schools will be safely reopened? Q.  The President. So can you assure anybody of anything? I do say, again: Young people are almost immune to this disease. The younger, the better, I guess. They're stronger. They're stronger. They have a stronger immune system. It's an incredible thing. Nobody has ever seen this before. Various types of flu will hurt young people more than older people. The President. But young people are almost immune. If you look at the percentage, it's a tiny percent of 1 percent. It's a tiny percent of 1 percent. So we have to have our schools open. We have to protect our teachers. We have to protect our elderly. But we do have to have our schools open. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Yes, please. Go ahead. The President. Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. Mr. President, a week ago, you said: ""We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very powerful,"" involving the coronavirus. Where is that strategy? Q.  The President. Oh, I think you're seeing it, and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we've done that we're getting—and it hasn't been utilized fully yet—but we're all set to march when it comes to the vaccine. The President. We have great therapeutics that are testing very well, and we have great vaccines from incredible companies—Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer and Merck—— Q. But—[inaudible]—actually slowing the spread of the virus? Q.  inaudible The President. ——and all of these great companies, and they're doing very well. The President. — And the delivery system is all set, logistically. We have a general that—that's all he does, is deliver things, whether it's soldiers or other items. And I think you're going to see something that's going to be spectacular. The FDA has approved things at a rate that's a tiny fraction of what it would cost—what it would take during a—another administration, let's say. We are way ahead on vaccines, way ahead on therapeutics. And when we have it, we're all set up with our platforms to deliver them very, very quickly. The vaccines are doing well, the therapeutics are doing well, and we're all set to deliver them as soon as we have them, and that's going to be very soon. Thank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1247"

          Aug 03, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias. It's a very interesting name. Last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I've issued emergency declarations to support a response in both of those areas. So that's Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The President. This week, the storm passed just east of Florida. Got a little bit lucky. Didn't hit Florida too hard. Working with the Governor, working with everybody. But it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might. It's currently off the coast of South Carolina, heading northward to North Carolina. It's expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a category 1 hurricane. Very serious. A lot of water. A lot of water coming from that storm. I've already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina. And FEMA's personnel—and they are great; they're doing a job—they're already on the ground in all areas. Every single area that we mentioned is covered. Over the next several days, there's expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey. We're working with each of those States, and in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement—all of the different groups that are involved. Storm surge and inland flooding are possible, and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the State and local authorities. We're working with them. And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far. So stay safe. Next, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus. We're beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6 percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to 8 percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign—very encouraging, I have to add—that the virus is receding. In hotspots across the South and West, we've seen slow improvements. From their recent weekly peaks, Arizona's weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent. That's a tremendous drop. And the Governor and the State have done a fantastic job. Down 37 percent. Texas down 18.7 percent. I was there a couple of days ago. And Florida, 21.2-percent drop. So that's a tremendous job that they're all doing. As we begin to contain the virus in these States, we must focus on new flareups in the States where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri. And I think you'll find that they're soon going to be very much under control. Meanwhile, 18 States continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates, under 5 percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It's under five. Even in these States, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful, in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those States. To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places, and to protect the elderly—very, very important—protect the elderly. It's much different. Young children have very strong immune systems. We've learned how strong they are. But protect the elderly. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. That's the average age. It's important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward, and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent. As we're seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging—you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough, invisible enemy—lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don't. It comes back. Many times, it comes back. The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially as it respects to—with respect to hospitals; learn more about the disease; and develop effective treatments, as we did in the United States. We're doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics. Countries where there have been very significant flareups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan. And also, as you probably heard, in Hong Kong, they've had some very serious flareups. Japan has gone—yes, a lot, six-fold—six-fold flare up. That's a lot. But they'll get it under control. In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school, with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them. At the same time, we're placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment, and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine. The vaccines are coming along incredibly well. Today I'd like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we've done. We're taking—really taking an increased interest, and we're seeing numbers that nobody can even believe, in terms of percentage increase. It's telehealth for American patients. The percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it's very, very significant, numbers that you would not even think possible. This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA health care team. And it worked out really well. We have a 91-percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we're doing. This is the first—it's the highest ever recorded. Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA, and it's becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens. You don't have to go to the doctor's office; you don't have to go to hospitals. When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience. And really, they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes. Today I'm taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay. Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an Executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent. We've done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we're doing on medicine and medical and what we're doing. They can do things that you wouldn't believe, that even a year ago, 2 years ago would not have been doable. We're enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient. And very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you. The order builds upon a series of actions we've all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That's no additional cost. And copayments can be waived for telehealth services. We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices. And I will tell you that the ""favored nations"" clause that I've signed into existence—nobody thought anybody would ever do that—has a massive impact on prescription drug prices, in addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, in particular prescription drugs. But the ""favored nations"" clause is massive. For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example—just as an example—and the United States pays $2 for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right as they do. We never had that before. We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development. So the numbers are astronomical. And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by Big Pharma. Very big ads. Very massive buy. But, in the meantime, they're calling. They want to know if they can make a deal. And I say to people, ""The only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you."" And they understand that. I think our people understand that. But, in particular, when you look at the matching—you could call it ""matching"" or you could call it ""favored nations""—call it whatever you like—it's a tremendous—it's going to have a tremendous—and I'm talking about 50, 60 percent, 70 percent. That doesn't mean it goes to 10 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up, and ours goes down. And you have many, many countries where their numbers—the numbers are so low. I mean, so low. And by that, I mean, much lower than the United States. Another thing I'm doing is if a certain country, like Canada—Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought. How they allowed this to happen—representatives of our country standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office—how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. We've been working on this for a long time. I've been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So now a Governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida—who is doing a great job—or our great Governor of Ohio or a great Governor of any State can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50-percent less. So we'll be buying from Canada. Now, what the drug companies are going to do—maybe they'll raise them, maybe they'll lower them, or maybe they'll just give up and sell them to us directly much cheaper. So a lot of things are happening. Also, the rebate—we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them. Nobody knows who they are. I guess, in some cases, they can be pharmacies; in some cases, they're individuals. We're doing a rebate, and the rebate goes to the people. It lowers the price of drugs. So we have a series of four things that we signed. And you will see, over a period—a fairly short period—drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible. We have—in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration. It was last year. Fifty-one years it went up. But that was just a small decline. This is a massive decline. This is a decline that nobody can believe. I was called by Senators, I was called by Congressmen, ""Please don't do this."" But Big Pharma doesn't mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job. We want them to get their vaccines. We want them to do what has to be done. So I think you're going to see drug price reductions over the next 4 or 5 or 6 months—it will probably take a little while to kick in—that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn't believe. But in the meantime—they called on Friday afternoon—they want to meet and see if they do something else. They don't like ""favored nations"" clauses. I understand that. We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services—through telehealth, by the way—including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority. We brought the substance abuse—at least prior to the China plague or whatever you want to call it—we brought it down very substantially. Pediatric critical care and much more. Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services. So a very, very big priority on telehealth. As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help health care providers and hospitals expand their telehealth. And they're all doing it. They're doing it gladly. Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic—whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it—but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn't anything raging. And I guess one of the only good things that we've gotten out of this whole horrible situation is, telehealth has been incredible. And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before. Do you have a number? It's like 2,000 percent or something like that. It's an incredible increase. You'll get the number. But it's—I think they have it now finally, and it's really an incredible—thank you, Kayleigh. We worked with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus. We cut redtape to allow many services to be conducted by phone, rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone. So you're talking about six-point—3.6 million seniors. That's something. Ten-point-one million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. So you're talking there 10.1 million people. In April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February. Those are part of the numbers that I think—I'll have you get them. So this part, you don't have to; you'll get the other section. Thank you. So think of that: compared to less than 0.1 percent—0.1 percent. That's an incredible number. So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to—so you went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent. That's an incredible—that's an incredible number. The Executive order I signed today will also expand health care access in rural America. We take care of rural America. It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure. And we're working very hard with all of the people in Government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. Additionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business. Many, many are having a very difficult time. To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility—really, great flexibility—and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients. Furthermore, I'm directing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission—we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium—to form a Task Force that will break down barriers to expanding rural health care. This order continues my administration's focus on rural health care. We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas. We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals and more than 2,400 rural health clinics. We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time—and these are people that had great reputations and great track records—for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients. We're also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the State and local areas have the supplies they need. We've been supplying hospitals and cities and States, Governors—helping Governors—at a number that nobody has ever heard of before. Fifteen-thousand-four-hundred-and-forty nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment. They're very much stocked up; they're in great shape. They all have the ventilators—all the ventilators they need. They have, actually, more than they need. And their equipment—medical equipment is in very, very good shape. They're full. My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves, and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide. We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we've been talking about together on vaccines and treatments. Under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting—most exciting—last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Had great results. This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia. And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along. Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late-stage illness. They've been very good. We're also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies, and that, we're working on. And that's a brilliant art. It's really an art. And we launched a national plasma drive last week—I was at the Red Cross building—with the American Red Cross and 13 other health care organizations. I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov—coronavirus.gov—and donate plasma today. We would really appreciate it. This really makes people better. But we need—what we need is, we need that beautiful ingredient that you, that got better, seem to have in your veins. You have to go to coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. It will be tremendous. We really appreciate it if you do it, because we're low. We're low. We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing. It will take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative. Makes people better. And you know, you had something very special. You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it. So whatever you can do—coronavirus.gov. As a result of improvements we've made in treatment, for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak. Eighty-five percent decline. On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]* to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine. One hundred million doses. This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting. We are supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, who are having wonderful results, and they're in final stages of testing. There are now two vaccines in the—in that final stage of clinical trials in America, with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately. And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies. These are great companies. These are companies that are not only well known, they're well respected, most importantly. We're balancing speed and safety, and we're on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year. And we're mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we're ready immediately upon approval. We have our military lined up. It's logistics; it's all about logistics. They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers. But now they'll be doing vaccine. Our general is all ready to go, and he's very excited. And once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he'll start the process. They will start the process, and they'll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond, if it works as we think it probably will. By unleashing America's technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic, and we will, hopefully, end it very quickly. The therapeutics are very exciting to me—where you can go into a hospital, and whether it's through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody, and they get better. That's something, to me, that's very important. And we're doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines. So thank you all very much for being here. We'll take a couple of questions. Yes, please. Death of Servicemembers in a U.S. Marine Corps Training Accident Off the California Coast  Death of Servicemembers in a U.S. Marine Corps Training Accident Off the California Coast  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. So if I can ask your response to two items in the news and ask a COVID question. First, do you have any—have you been briefed on the incident off the coast of California, where the marines and the Navy corpsman—hospitalman died in a training accident a couple day—over the weekend? Q.  The President. They're actually briefing me in a little while. We have it scheduled for a little while from now. The President. Q. Are you hoping to speak to the families? Q.  The President. Oh, it's terrible. No, it's terrible, and we'll be in contact with the families. A thing like that is terrible. The President. New York City District Attorney's Investigation of Trump Organization/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election  New York City District Attorney's Investigation of Trump Organization/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election  Q. Separately, in New York today, the city prosecutor, sort of, confirmed a criminal investigation into the Trump Organization. Do you have any reaction to that? The President. Well, I just heard about it. This is just a continuation of the witch hunt. It's Democrat stuff. They failed with Mueller. They failed with everything. They failed with Congress. They failed at every stage of the game. Q.  The President. This has been going on for 3½, 4 years. Even before I got in, this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after, but it started with some of the people that you know very well, the names—Strzok and Page and all of the different people—Comey. This has been going on. This is a continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history, and there's nothing that I know even about it. You know, they had—I had seen that today just a little while ago. And I said, ""What's this all about?"" I know nothing about it. But it's just a continuation of the witch hunt. It didn't work out for Congress, didn't work out for Mueller, didn't work out for anybody. So what they're doing is, they send them around to all over the country, I guess, maybe. But it's a terrible thing that they do. It's really a terrible thing. The witch hunt has gone on long enough. Okay? What else? Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. Just one on COVID: You mentioned the vaccine development program. Could you assure the American people that politics and considerations around the election will not interfere in the science? Q.  The President. Oh, absolutely not. Absolutely not. The President. Q. And do you plan on playing a role in determining how the vaccine will—if there is one—will be distributed across the country? Is that something that you would discuss? Q.  The President. It's possible that I get involved. But no, it won't have anything to do with—we want to make people better. We want to send them to the areas that most need it. And I think we're going to have something very soon. It's going good The President. Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], please. Federal Coronavirus Response  Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Mr. President, you said today in a tweet that Dr. Birx was taking bait from Speaker Pelosi. What did you mean by that, considering that she was just describing the facts about the case of the pandemic right now across the country? Q.  The President. Well, I think we're doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look—if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flareups in nations that they were talking about—and don't forget: We're much bigger, other than India and China. China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems. The President. And I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like, we thought we might be over it in Florida, and then, all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back. But I think we're doing very well. I told Dr. Birx I think we're doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She's a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi has treated her very badly—very, very badly. Very nasty. And I'm just referring to the fact that I thought that, really, they should say the job we've done, whether it's on ventilators or testing—we've tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great—in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. And I think we're just doing very well. Q. Does that mean—just to—— Q.  The President. Yes, go ahead. The President. Q. Just to follow up, just quickly: Does that mean you disagree with her characterization, Mr. President? Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. The President. TikTok  TikTok  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on two things that you said earlier in the Cabinet Room. The first was on TikTok, and the second was on coronavirus. Q.  On TikTok, you said that you wanted money for the U.S. Treasury for the sale. The President. Yes. The President Q. Does that mean that you expect the Chinese company to pay the U.S. Treasury directly or are you talking about—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible The President. Either way. Whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, or if it was the Chinese, what the price is, the United States could—should get a very large percentage of that price because we're making it possible. Without us—you know, I use the expression, ""It's like the landlord and the tenant."" And without the lease, the tenant doesn't have the value. Well, we're sort of, in a certain way, the lease. We make it possible to have this great success. TikTok is a tremendous success, but a big portion of it is in this country. The President. Q. So from the sale directly, you would— Q.  The President. It would come from the sale, yes. Whatever the number is would—it would come from the sale——— The President. Q. And then, you mentioned—— Q.  The President. ——which nobody else would be thinking about but me. But that's the way I think. And I think it's a—I think it's very fair. The President. — Q. And you mentioned—— Q.  The President. But we want no security problems with China. It's got to be an American company. It's got to be American security. It's got to be owned here. We don't want to have any problems with security, et cetera. And something could come out. I will tell you, there's a lot of excitement not only by Microsoft, but by other companies, in terms of buying it. The President. So we'll see what happens. But we want and we think we deserve to have a big percentage of that price coming to America, coming to the Treasury. Moratorium on Evictions/The President's Executive Authority  Moratorium on Evictions/The President's Executive Authority  Q. And then, on the negotiation on Capitol Hill, you expressed some frustration and said you might take executive action to address—— Q.  The President. I might do that, yes. Q. So I was wondering if you could talk about both how you might prevent evictions through executive action and then also if there—— The President. Q.  The President. Yes, I could do that if I want, and I want to do that. I don't want people to be evicted. And you know, when they're evicted, when they're thrown out of their, whatever the place may be, in many cases, they go to big shelters. And if you talk about pandemic, this is a pandemic, and they go to shelters. Number one, they're thrown out viciously. It's not their fault, it's China's fault. It's not anybody's fault, it's China's fault. The President. But number two, and if they are thrown out, they oftentimes will go to a shelter with tremendous numbers of other people. And the virus will spread, and we don't want that. Payroll Tax Deductions/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Payroll Tax Deductions/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Are you considering suspending payroll—the collection of payroll taxes? Q.  The President. Well, I can do that also through an Executive order. So we'll be talking about that. The President. But we're having a very good discussion with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The problem is they want to do bailouts of their various Democrat-run States and cities, and they want a lot of money. They want a trillion dollars for that. And so they want to do much more than COVID related. They want to do—they want to bail out cities and States that have been in trouble for years of bad management—in all cases, Democrat-run cities—and we don't think that's fair. You understand that. You've heard it before. Yes, please. Go ahead. Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to U.S. Cities/National Guard  Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to U.S. Cities/National Guard  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the Justice Department sending Federal agents into cities like Chicago as part of Operation LeGend. How exactly do you envision these Federal forces working alongside local police departments to help stop violent crime? Q.  The President. Yes. It's not a mass send, but it's sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It's not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which, as an example, a lot of progress has been made in Portland. But you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again. The President. This is—these are Democrat-run cities and States, and it hasn't been a pretty picture to watch. We will help Chicago. We'll help New York, if they request. They have to request the help, but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and—but what it is, is drug related, gang related. Largely gang related. With ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13—thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or, in some cases, have to put them in prison. They're too violent. They're truly violent. So we're helping out. When you look at what's happening in Chicago and some other cities with the shootings and the killings, they need help. And we haven't met with resistance, I have to be honest with you. I think it's good that we haven't. But we're only looking to help them. We're only looking to help. OAN. OAN. Absentee Voting Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election/U.S. Postal Service  Absentee Voting Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election/U.S. Postal Service  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In our Nation's 243-year history, there's never been a stronger push for mail-in ballots to determine a national election. Q.  The President. Yes. The President Q. Are you considering, at any point, issuing an Executive order addressing mail-in ballots? And why do you think some people are pushing it so hard? Q.  The President. Well, there's never been a push like this for mail-in ballots. And if you look at the New York Congressional race, which is a disaster—Carolyn—it's been a total disaster. They have—they're 6 weeks into it now. They have no clue what's going on. And, I mean, I think I can say right here and now, I think you have to rerun that race, because it's a mess. The President. Nobody knows what's happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess. I think you'd probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? And this is a small race with literally thousands of people—small thousands—and it's all messed up. You look at Paterson, New Jersey, it's all messed up. Almost every one of these—and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy. Now you're talking about, like, Nevada, where last—2 nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved a ridiculous—you don't have to look at signatures. You don't have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It's a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it's a disgrace. So it's a very good question. I mean, the mail-in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races—congressional race in New York, it should be very easy. Normally, that would have been announced at 7 o'clock, and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour, and they would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about 6 weeks ago, and they have no clue what's going on. They've lost ballots. There's fraudulent ballots. It's—how are you going to do that for an entire nation? They're using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, they have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster. And what Nevada has been doing—if you look, over the last few days, you have to look at what they've done. You can have two ballots, you can harvest—it's harvesting, so you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody's desk after a certain period of time. They have something where, if you vote, the vote can count up to 7 days later. Well, if the vote is going to count 7 days later, that means you—you know, if it depends on the one State like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can't have—supposing it's down to that one State—it could be—it's a great State. But supposing it's down to that one State, that means you have to wait 7 days. But they won't have it there. This is something that's so messed up. And by the way, I have to say, the Post Office, for many, many years, has been, you know, run in a fashion that hasn't been great. Great workers and everything, but they have old equipment—very old equipment. And I don't think the Post Office is prepared for a thing like this. You'll have to ask the people at the Post Office. But how can the Post Office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing, and then now, on top of that, they have the internet, where you have Amazon and these companies doing, you know, all the buying—instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail. So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the Post Office, purchases of items and gifts, and that's a tremendous strain on the Post Office. The Post Office loses a fortune, and it has been for many, many years, for decades. So now, on top of it, it has this, and the Amazons of the world and the others, they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every—the Post Office loses money, which is ridiculous, on every package it delivers. But now, on top of that—and I'm not just referring to Amazon, I'm talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing, to Amazon. There will be. But if there is such a thing. But now, on top of that, you'll have somebody like the Governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan, out of nowhere, to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that State. It will get messed up just like New York and just like Paterson, New Jersey and just like many other places. In West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad. You know that. And—but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you'll be able to find—there's a list of them all over the country. And that has to do with universal mail-in. Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they'll do absentee. It really works. But universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country. Q. Would you consider an Executive order on this? Is that appropriate? Q.  The President. Well, I have the right to do it. We haven't gotten there yet, but we'll see what happens. We will be suing in Nevada, and that's already been taken care of. We'll probably file something tomorrow. The President. I do want to say that we're going to be introducing a tremendous health care plan sometime prior—hopefully, prior to the end of the month. It's just completed now. In addition, next month, we'll be doing the immigration plan. So we'll be doing that in September. We'll be doing, sometime during this month, the health care plan. And I think that will be before the end of the month. And I think it will be very impressive to a lot of people. Thank you very much. Thank you. Q. Mr. President—— Q.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1248"
"13","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 04, 2020        ","The President. Hello, everybody. Thank you very much. Let me begin by sending America's deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack. The President. I also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they're working very hard. Coastal areas in the storm's path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to States that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those States; we can give them to you in a little while. And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely. We have the military on guard, but we have—FEMA is there, in all cases. The Corps of Engineer is ready if needed—the Army Corps of Engineers. Very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm's path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your State and local authorities. I now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management—that's ""ISM""; most of you know it by ""ISM""—increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2—that's fantastic—the highest reading since March of 2019. This is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots. The ISM measures—and it's a very strong measure of new orders. It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018. That's a big number. Since the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points—that's the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM's measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years. That's some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I've been saying we're doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular. Automobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly. Its 65-percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a massive number. The great strength and great news is really for States like—in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, a little bit. These are great numbers, record-setting numbers. The strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand—literally, soaring demand—is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector—and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers. We're very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way. Economy-wide, inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing. That's the largest drop ever on record—ever. Homebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. And new homes recently made a 13-year high. So we have a 13-year high in new home construction. New business applications are very strong. That just came out. The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP—and it's something that they have just come out with—now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it's showing a 20-percent annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20 percent in the current quarter; we'll take that all day long. I—let's see if that's right. That's a projection. So we'll see if that's right. The Atlanta Fed, very respected. The virus—back to that—we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West. And we're seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for—ever since we've gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that's been unleashed on our country by China. As of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday. That's a big, big number. Eleven out of 13 States with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other States, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good—States that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent. And in the States with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. We must ensure that these States do not become new flareups, so we're watching them very, very closely. Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths. Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the death—the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much—one death—because this should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped at—very easily, by China, in Wuhan. Thanks to our major advances in treatment, we've seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April, mortality rates are 85-percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70-percent lower among individuals over 70 years old. We've also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly. Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65—just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications. Since the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That's an incredible statistic, when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk. As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we're doing that. We're doing that at a level that we've never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlining [underlying]* conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining—whether it's heart or diabetes—they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school. Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that's what we're doing. This is the science-based approach, and that's good with us. Working very hard on that. An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. So there won't be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas. We're very careful, and we're putting out embers. We're putting out flames. When you look at what's happening with Miami, and it's going—the numbers are going down. But Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly. On telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as—and as I said numerous times during this day, it's an incredible thing that's happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes. And that's what's happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million—so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week. In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That's a tremendous thing that's happened with telehealth. As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you've read and seen what's happened today. Today's news was very exciting. Through Operation Warp Speed, we're also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we're determined to have a vaccine very quickly. We think we're going to have something very soon. We have great companies. These are the—among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don't like me so much because I'm forcing them to drop drug prices—prescription drug prices—very massively. Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren't. We're having a tremendous—you'll see a tremendous drop in price. We're using favored nations; we're using the rebates. We're using everything. For so long, I've heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them ""the middlemen."" And they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they're very wealthy people. And we're doing the rebates. We're doing purchases from other countries, like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system. I don't call it ""archaic""; I call it ""bad"" because it's meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices. But under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we're allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same—the same as the lowest country in the world. If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that's the price we're going to get. Drug companies aren't too happy about that, Big Pharma. We've also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today the NIH—we're—very exciting—announced that they're beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We're going to move very quickly. Results look very good already. Incredible results. More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we've secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir—of remdesivir. We're really doing a job with it, and it's helping a lot of people. That's why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that's for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That's big news. The United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we've been able to do. Nobody is even close. Since March 12, we've increased daily testing by 32,000 percent. How's that? Thirty-two thousand percent. Somebody would say, ""That must be a typo."" It's not a typo. Thirty-two thousand percent. We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week. And now that we're understanding the virus, we're understanding very much what we're doing with respect to who it affects, who it's destroying, and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We'll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing. I call it ""focus testing."" By comparison, Mexico—so we're doing numbers that are incredible. But by comparison, Mexico—as you know, the President was here; he's a great guy—but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada is around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together. It's been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we're doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs—for it to come back from labs. Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California. And this week, we're opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta. To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites. Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual's blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than—we have new numbers—more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves—billion. Can you believe that? Billion gloves. And we distribute that to the Governors, different States. And they're—when we get on the phone with them, they're very happy, that I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They're very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we've done. In our National Stockpile, we've tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day, and we're now making thousands of ventilators—many thousands of ventilators—a month. And we're getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They're very hard to produce. They're very complicated machines. So we're fully stocked here, and we've made sure that every State is fully stocked, but we're getting them to a lot of countries that need help. We'll continue to work with the Governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I'm more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. And I want to thank you all for being here. We'll take a few questions. Yes, please. Eastman Kodak Company  Eastman Kodak Company  Q. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Kodak. You had a big announcement the other day about getting Kodak into the pharmaceutical business, but the SEC is now investigating what happened. Can you say a word or two whether you think that there might have been some kind of a problem in terms of how those arrangements were made? Is there any grounds for concern, from your perspective? Q.  The President. Well, I don't know. I wasn't involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I'll let you know. We'll do a little study on that, and we'll find out. The President. Q. Okay. And—— Q.  The President. If there's—if there is any problem, we'll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn't involved in it. The President. It's a big deal. It's a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to the pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we'll see what that's all about, but we'll let you know very quickly. Yes, please. Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Q. I just wanted to follow up, before I ask a coronavirus question, on Lebanon. You called this an ""attack."" Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident? Q.  The President. Well, it would seem like it, based on the explosion. I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a—some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was a—seems to be, according to them—they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes. The President. Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Q. Interesting. And, on coronavirus, you've talked a lot about—when you talk about the mortality rate, the deaths as a proportion of cases, which—I understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does at keeping people alive——— Q.  The President. Right. The President. Q. ——who get infected. But when you're talking about the scope of this virus, when you look at the percentage of the population that's died, there's only three countries that have more deaths than the U.S. So how do you explain that: that—why the percentage of the population who has died is so much higher in the U.S.? The President. Well, I think, actually, the numbers are lower than others. I'll get back to you on that. But we, proportionately, are lower than almost all countries. We're at the bottom of the list. Q.  The President. And we're—relative to cases, also, we're at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing, being at the bottom of the list. But I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we're, generally speaking, at the very bottom of the list. So I'll get back to you. Q. Because when I—when I look at the Johns Hopkins, you know, Coronavirus Resource Center on their website, it says the most affected countries, when you look at deaths per 100,000 people of the population—so how many people in the population have died—you have the U.K., Peru, Chile, and then the U.S. Q.  You know, Canada has 8,000, 9,000 deaths. Obviously, they're smaller than us, but that's only 6 percent of the population—you know, that's 6 percent of our total cases. So why are the deaths so much higher in the U.S.? The President. Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the—New York had a very tough time, as you know. New York, New Jersey—that area. And when you take them out—just as an example, take a look at Florida, relative to New York. The President. That's not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together. It's crowded. It's not easy. But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in—I will get back to you, but we have among the lowest numbers. They've done a fantastic job on it. Yes, please. Go ahead. Economic Stimulus Legislation/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to Portland, Oregon/The President's Executive Authority/Moratorium on Evictions  Economic Stimulus Legislation/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to Portland, Oregon/The President's Executive Authority/Moratorium on Evictions  Q. Yes, Mr. President. I would like to ask a question about the election, but one thing on unemployment first. Are you considering taking executive action to extend or, rather, reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week, if Congress can't get a deal by the end of the week? Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. And, as a general point, what rate, then, would you want in there: a percentage or a flat rate? Q.  The President. We are looking at it. We're also looking at various other things that I'm allowed to do under the system, and—such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we're allowed to do things. The President. We're talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat-run States and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean, really bad management. So that seems to be where they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some cases, radical-left Democrats that have not done a good job. I appreciate—today the Wall Street Journal said very good things—that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in. Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the folks—we went into Portland, and we've done a great job. And they had that in an editorial, that we really won that situation. But we want the whole—we did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in. We took care of it. And we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said. As far as the various things that I may or may not sign: I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made, as you know very well, on the Hill. We'll see what happens. But I have the right—including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things. We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It's not their fault. It's China's fault; it's not their fault. And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an Executive order. So if we don't get—and we want to do it relatively quickly. I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters. And this is not a time—you never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it, and it's no good. So I may have to do something on evictions too, because the Democrats, amazingly, don't want to do it. We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out States that have been poorly managed by Democrats. Okay. Please, go ahead. Q. And if I could, on the election, sir—can I—— Q.  TikTok/Microsoft Corporation  TikTok/Microsoft Corporation  Q. President Trump, on the sale of TikTok, you're basically arguing that the U.S. Government is going to collect a cut from a—of a transaction including two companies, in which it doesn't hold a stake in. Q.  That's unprecedented. That's never happened in U.S. history before, and the administration has offered very little explanation about how that's going to work. Can you back your statement up and provide specifics about how that would work? The President. Did you say, ""That's impressive""? Did you actually use that term? The President. Q. I said it's ""unprecedented."" Q.  The President. Oh, unprecedented—well, it's almost the same thing. Not quite. [Laughter] I like ""impressive."" I like ""impressive"" much better. Not quite, but close. The President. Laughter So TikTok—TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends—when they saw that announcement, they're calling. And I think their kids love it; they don't. Because they don't get to see their kids anymore, but they are—it's an amazing thing, whatever it may be. And I told Microsoft—and frankly, others—if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok—whether it's the 30 percent in the United States or the whole company, I say: ""It's okay. But if you do that, we're really making it possible, because we're letting you operate here."" So the United States Treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers. And I said, ""Inform""—— Q. [Inaudible]—through a tax, or how? Q.  Inaudible The President. Very simple. I mean we have—we have all the cards because, without us, you can't come into the United States. It's like if you're a landlord, and you have a tenant. The tenant's business needs a rent; it needs a lease. And so what I said to them is, ""Whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the Treasury of the United States."" The President. And they understood that. And actually, they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much. Yes, please. In the back. Q. Thank you, sir. Q.  The President. So that deal may or may not happen. We've given them until September 15 or so, and we'll see. The President. If we can have it and there can be great security—meaning, the obvious security—Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect. They're approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense. And you know, they're very high-level approvals. So it would be good, but there are other companies also. Yes, please. TikTok/Security Risks of Foreign Technology Companies/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  TikTok/Security Risks of Foreign Technology Companies/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. Thank you, sir. Have you or the—anyone in the administration reached out to other companies, aside from Microsoft, to see if they're interested in maybe buying—— Q.  The President. No, we've had other companies call us, and Microsoft called me directly. And we've had other companies call. I don't know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don't blame them. It'd be—you know, it's great company. It's really a great company. The President. But we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, including Huawei, which as you know, we put a halt to. But we can't take the security risk. I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world, and it shouldn't have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don't know. When you lose—— Q. Can you say what other companies? Q.  The President. ——when you lose so many thousands of people, and—you know, ultimately, it'll be millions of people around the world. It's a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing. The President.  Yes, please. Go ahead. Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two quick questions: one on the virus and one on policing. On the virus, you said recently that there can be ""too much testing."" Can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many Americans for the virus and why you haven't provided a date by which all Americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the White House? Q.  The President. Well, we do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained—and I don't mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they're at about 11 million, and we're at 61 million. And there comes a point when you just—you want to focus your testing in a different way. And we'll be announcing some—what we've done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing—— The President. Q. Is there a downside though? The President. ——not only the number of tests, but also, very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing. Q.  The President.  Nobody thought it would be possible to get a 5-minute and a 15-minute result that's a very accurate result, and we do, with Abbott. Abbott Laboratories has done a great job. Many of these companies have done an incredible job. So we're looking at that very strongly. And we're looking at doing something that if we do—if we do it—look, right now what the testing is doing is helpful, but we're spending massive amounts of money, and we want to have it—we want to have it channeled very accurately. We want to be able to help the most people we can. But we are testing at a level that no country in the world—and I've spoken to the leaders of the world, and they'll ask me about it—no country in the world thought it would be—it's even believable that we're able to test so much. Sixty-one million versus—you know, most countries don't even test. You know when they test? When somebody is feeling badly. If somebody is feeling badly, they're symptomatic, that's when they test. And that's a big difference. With us, we go around and—looking, because if we find—we find spots. We find hotspots. One problem is, from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show. So it's—you know, as I called it the other day in a statement, I said it's called ""media gold."" You know, for the media, it's gold. But the truth is, it's—we've done an incredible job on testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing; they can't believe we're able to do it. Q. And—[inaudible]. Q.  inaudible The President. And we will continue, but we want to really be able to test, very specifically, the people that are in most danger, most in need. The President. All right. Please, go ahead. Q. And, on policing, sir—— Q.  Absentee Voting Policies/Florida/New York Democratic Primary Election/Nevada  Absentee Voting Policies/Florida/New York Democratic Primary Election/Nevada  Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you first about what you tweeted out earlier today, in regards to Florida, and your comfortableness, as it relates to mail-in ballots—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——for Florida. What—— Q.  The President. Okay, I'm glad you're asking. The President. Q. Why does that apply to Florida and it doesn't apply to mail-in balloting across the country? Q.  The President. So Florida has got a great Republican Governor, and it had a great Republican Governor. It's got Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott—two great Governors. And over a long period of time, they've been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other States. The President. I mean, in Nevada, where you have a Governor—he said, ""Let's just send out millions of ballots,"" and the Post Office cannot be prepared; I haven't spoken to the Post Office about it, but I don't know how they could possibly be prepared. Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in—and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify. They're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything. They've done a great job, really a great job. And the two Governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the—even in the case of mail-in ballots, the postal services have built up their—you know, it takes a long time. When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they—and I'll give you the story: I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look. In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don't know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there—it's a disaster. And that's only for a relatively small number of ballots. But I think they have to do the election in New York over. The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It's a disaster. It's a mess. And they have to do that—I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is. So, in the case of Florida, they've done a great job, and they've had tremendous success with it. But they've been doing this over many years, and they've made it really terrific. So, for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don't have to go. In maybe a couple of other States, they've worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn't take weeks or months. In the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can't do that. I can't imagine the Post Office could do it. All of sudden, they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots? But Florida has done a great job, and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it's going to matter. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1249"
"14","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 05, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much, everybody. It's good to be with you. I'd like to begin by providing an update on my administration's actions to protect American workers as we battle the China virus. Since the virus escaped China, my administration has enacted $3 trillion in economic relief. It's been very, very successful, and you saw that by the numbers that were issued yesterday and the day before, as to used car sales and auto production. They've been incredible numbers actually. Shockingly incredible. The President. We've been negotiating in good faith with Democrat leaders in the House to extend relief payments. We're negotiating right now as we speak, and we'll see how that works out. But if Democrat leaders put partisan demands aside, we would reach an agreement very quickly. It happened—it would happen very quickly. In the meantime, my administration is exploring executive actions to provide protections against eviction—eviction is a big problem, very unfair to a lot of people; it wasn't their fault that this virus came from a faraway land—as well as additional relief to those who are unemployed, as a result of the virus. Very importantly, I'm also looking at a term-limited suspension of the payroll tax, something that has great support from many, many sides, especially some of our top economists and some people that we have great respect for. So we're looking at a suspension of the payroll tax. The Democrats are primarily interested in a $1 trillion bailout of the poorly run States. We have some States and cities—you know them all; we don't have to go through names—but they've been very poorly run over the years. And we can't go along with the bailout money. We're not going to go along with it, especially since it's not COVID related. Earlier today I met with a great Governor, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. He's really done a fantastic job, beyond even the COVID situation, which you've been reading about as it pertains to Arizona, a State that is a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown. Arizona's record in reducing the spread of the virus while maintaining hospital capacity and allowing society to continue functioning—and functioning very nicely, very successfully—is an example that shows how our path forward can work in other States. Arizona has a record—and a record, really, to be proud of. It's reduced the number of daily new cases by over 75 percent, cut the positivity rate in half, and reduced ER visits by two thirds, all the while keeping the economy functioning and functioning really well. When cases surged in June, the Vice President and Dr. Birx visited Arizona to consult with Governor Ducey. They had long consultations with Governor Ducey and his staff, and the Vice President has been in constant contact ever since. My administration is also collaborating with the State and local officials across the South and Midwest to provide similar guidance. We had a great relationship with the representatives in Arizona, and it's been such a successful endeavor. The Federal Government has supplied or delivered more than 400 million pieces of personal protective equipment to Arizona, along with nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir. We've provided over one—excuse me, we provided over $18 billion in economic support to Arizona, including more than $8.6 billion to support over 80,000 small businesses. So we really have been helping Arizona, and it's gotten tremendous results. Our goal is to protect the most vulnerable, increase recovery rates—you know that; it's something so important—and prevent hospital overcrowding, all the while avoiding the kind of stringent lockdowns that would inflict substantial suffering in the phase—and this phase of the battle. We have the tools, resources, and knowledge to implement a targeted approach as we race to deliver a vaccine. And we are really working very hard on the vaccine, and we're doing—I think they're doing a fantastic job. I've been meeting with officials of some of the greatest companies in the world and meeting with scientists, and they're getting very close. If not there, they're getting very close. They're testing. Any proper analysis of infection control measures must take into account the short-term and long-term public health harms, including death caused by a far-reaching shutdown. When you shut down, you have many, many things that happen—from suicides to depression to drinking, alcohol problems, to drug problems, to problems with marriages. Problems with marriages. That—you have people confined to their house, their apartment for long periods of time, it can cause a lot of problems with that also. Instead, Arizona has adopted the following measures: The Governor advised residents to aggressively social distance when possible and maintain strict hygiene. The State encouraged mask use in crowded public places, especially when social distancing is not possible. The Governor also exercised his discretion to restrict capacity at indoor locations to limit the possibility of super spreading. It's a big thing. My administration surged treatments. We got them a lot of treatments and therapies to the State, including nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat over 11,000 patients, and it's been very successful, I might add. My administration also delivered PPE and point-of-care testing to over 100 Arizona nursing homes. In total, the Federal Government has provided massive amounts of masks and equipments and gowns, and you know some of those numbers. But Arizona was a very big beneficiary, and they very much received—very much really appreciated. More than 1,000 National Guard and medical personnel have also been deployed in Arizona, and they've really helped. They've been terrific, and I want to thank them. They have been brave and brilliant, combination of both. We also supported our Tribal communities. The Tribal communities were hit very, very hard. Governor Ducey and I personally delivered rapid testing systems to the Navajo Nation, which has been really, really in originally bad shape and now getting better and very, very quickly. The Navajo Nation now has one of the highest levels of testing per capita anywhere in the world. We really worked very hard on the Tribal areas. And in particular, in this case, the Navajo Nation, they've done incredibly well. Overall, Arizona has conducted over 1.1 million tests, more than the entire nations of Japan, Mexico, and Switzerland. Arizona's per capita testing is higher than Germany, South Korea, France, and Canada. And Tribal governments in Arizona have received nearly $1.3 billion for the Coronavirus Relief Fund. Meanwhile, outdoor dining, limited indoor dining, and most of the other businesses in Arizona have remained open and very vibrant. They're doing incredibly well. This is an approach, and it's an approach that's been incredibly successful. Arizona has been able to protect high-risk populations and quickly bring its outbreak under control without the need to impose overly punitive measures. Thanks to advances in treating the virus, the fatality rate across all age groups in Arizona is very low. Arizona's scientific and data-driven strategy also preserved hospital capacity, ensuring that those who need care were able to receive it and receive it immediately, very quickly. At the peak, approximately 15 percent of beds remained available statewide—that was at their peak—with roughly 20 percent of all occupied beds going to patients hospitalized for the virus. They kept other things going. They kept other forms of operations going. They kept elective surgery going. Did a really amazing job. Today, only 6 percent of the current hospitalizations in the State are related to the China virus. Arizona has also demonstrated success in protecting the State's African American population. Only 5 percent of patients hospitalized were African American, and African Americans represent just 2 percent of all deaths from the virus. As it has worked to contain its outbreak, Arizona has also been formulating a plan to get children safely back to school as soon as possible. We want our schools open all over the country. We want our schools open. Arizona has worked very hard on this, and they're doing very well. The Department of Education is providing Arizona schools with $625 million—they're working very hard—and that's in conjunction with CARES funding. My administration is actively working with other States in the same way we worked with Arizona. In recent weeks, members of the Coronavirus Task Force have visited over 15 States to encourage them to follow our path forward, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, and Ohio. And I'll be going to Ohio tomorrow. I look forward to it very much. It's a great place and a great State with an excellent Governor, and we look forward to being there tomorrow. Next week, Dr. Birx will be visiting Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas—and also, I believe they're trying to get in West Virginia, a great place, a great State, and I'm sure that will happen, because we'd like it to happen. They'd like to see her. So we're going to try very hard to get the doctor to West Virginia in addition to those States—to deliver aggressive, tailored, and targeted guidance. The strategy we're taking to these States will protect those at highest risk while allowing others at a lower risk to safely resume work and school. If we do this successfully, it can be really something incredible, because we're talking about a lot of States. We're talking about many, many States. It's really great to see also that Florida, we're coming down—it's coming down and pretty substantially in many locations. And even Miami is starting to come down. Miami was hit very hard. California likewise, and Texas likewise, coming down and really starting to be a substantial amount of reduction. It recognizes that prolonged lockdowns impose a wide range of serious public health threats, including higher levels of suicide, drug overdoses, and other significant health harms resulting from the depression that we talked about—social isolation, economic hardship. It's been very tough for those people that are put in a lockdown position for too long. It really has been a very tough and harmful situation for many people. The fact is that these harms are not measured daily here or abroad. It makes them really a very serious threat because people don't know exactly what they are and how bad they are, but I think they're very bad. Going forward, we must continue to remain vigilant in shielding the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, which is an incredible number and statistic, if you think about it. I also urge Americans to help us stop the spread of the virus: practice good hygiene, socially distance, avoid large crowds, and wear a mask where distancing is not possible. It's a patriotic thing to do. If you are sick, isolate yourself, especially from high-risk family members and friends. So important: Isolate yourself from high-risk family members and friends if you're not feeling well. Together, we will defeat the virus and emerge from this safer and stronger than ever. Thanks to the robust Federal action in partnership with State and local leaders, new cases of the virus are declining in 80 percent of the jurisdictions, which is an incredible number, and the overall test positivity rate has declined by 8 percent since last week. Zero States have seen outbreaks get worse since yesterday—so zero States. We're also continuing to make progress in the development of a vaccine. This is something so important. Also, therapeutics are on the front burner. We're having tremendous, I think—we'll let you know very soon, I think long before the end of the year—we're having tremendous success on therapeutics and tremendous success on vaccines, and we're ready to deliver them literally as soon as they're okayed. This morning my administration approved $1 billion for Johnson and Johnson, who's been working very hard—and they think they have something very special—to manufacture and distribute 100 million doses of a China virus vaccine as soon as one is available. And again, we think that's going to be soon, and we think we're going to have the vaccines before the end of the year, maybe long before the end of the year. Finally, today I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has issued $35 million in grants to 73 organizations nationwide, providing assistance to human trafficking victims. A terrible thing. You think of human trafficking as being an ancient form of crime. It's not. Because of the internet, it's a very modern crime all over the world, not just here—all over the world—human trafficking. It's usually in women or women and children. But it's—again, because of the internet, it's a terrible situation. Never been like this. And also, survivors who face heightened dangers during the pandemic—it's actually increased during the pandemic. I guess, some reasons are obvious, and some reasons are less obvious. But human trafficking, we're working very, very strongly. The wall is up to 277 miles right now, and it's going up by the end of the year. It will be largely finished, shortly after the end of the year. And it's had a tremendous impact, a very positive impact on human trafficking. Unbelievable impact, actually. My administration will never rest in our fight against the human trafficking. To me, it's one of the most horrific of crimes, and we work very hard on that. With that, we'll take some questions. Please. 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks/New York Democratic Primary Election  2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks/New York Democratic Primary Election  Q. Two quick questions. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, you said that voting by mail is an invitation to fraud. Could you lay out and tell us exactly where the evidence is right now that mail-in ballots in Nevada and other States will lead to widespread fraud? Q.  The President. Well, if you read, even the Washington Post had a terrible story on mail-in and the New York Times. And many, many newspapers have had terrible stories. You see them all over the internet. They've had some just horrible stories on mail-in ballots. The President. You look at Arizona [Nevada]*, you don't even have to have—as you know, they have a provision where they don't have to check signatures. So you sign it, and you could have a totally different signature. It's okay. It won't be approved. They have the right to go 7 days after the election for approval, so you're not even going to know who won the State of Nevada. Q. Were you—oh, you're talking about Nevada. Oh, I just want to point out we did call Nevada's Secretary of State's Office Election Division, and the spokeswoman there said that that simply isn't true, Mr. President, and that Nevada will continue to check ballot signatures against voter registration cards. It's done at the county level. Q.  The President. Okay, but that's not what they said when they approved it. They said they're not going to check signatures; they're not going to be able to. And their machinery, which is old, doesn't allow them to. So they're going to be—it's going to be physically impossible for them to do that, especially in a short period of time. The President. In addition, you have the November 3 election, and they're allowed to count votes until 7 days after the election. So what does that mean? If—if Nevada, which is a big State and a great State, a State I like very much—and I think we're going to do very well there—are we going to wait a week after November 3? If it comes down to Nevada, which it could very well. I don't think so. I don't think it's appropriate. So, with all of the bundling that you're going to have, with the harvesting you're going to have, with people being sent ballots all over that have, maybe, nothing to do with the State anymore, it's a terrible thing. In New York, they had the Carolyn Maloney situation. And I criticized it badly over the last 2 years and—2 days. I mean, I gave it some very, very strong criticism, and all of a sudden, like a miracle, they just approved the winner. Well, what happened? Did the person that was second concede the race even though it was very close and all mixed up? They have a terrible situation in New York with the ballots. You know that. And as soon as I said, ""Well, I think you should have a new election""—because the election, obviously, they're not going to know what to do—""I think you should have a new election,"" they, all of a sudden, announced a winner. I assume it was her. But they announced the winner. Well, I don't agree with it. Did somebody speak to the person on the other side, the opponent? Did they do something for the opponent on the other side? Take a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look at many things. It's all over newspapers what's going on with the mail-in ballots. They vote—they send out millions of ballots—millions of ballots. They're totally unprepared to do it, and then they come back in the millions. It's going to be a disaster. I'm doing our country a big favor by bringing it up. And you know, from a common-stance point, even—commonsense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure, basic, beautiful intelligence, you know it can't work. Now, Florida has worked very hard for years and years on developing a system, and I'm sure they probably have problems also. But absentee ballots are different than mail-in ballots—what you call ""universal mail-in ballots."" They're much different. You have to apply for it. You have to do different things, and it's a much better system, and it's a system that can be reasonably accurate. But there's no system like going to the poll and voting. So I would like to find out why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in the midst of all of this grief, why is it that they approved the New York race? Why you asked that question. Q. Well, the Maloney race, sir, there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud there. Q.  The President. Which one? The President. Q. Carolyn Maloney's primary. Q.  The President. Oh, really? Well, then you're reading—then you're reading a different newspaper than me. The President. Q. Well, the issues have to do with delays related to the delivery and the postmarking and the mail, sir. Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. Go ahead, please. Go. The President. Coronavirus Cases in the U.S  Coronavirus Cases in the U.S  Q. Sir, you said in an interview this morning on the coronavirus: ""This thing is going away. It will go away like things go away,"" despite ongoing cases and deaths. Q.  The President. It's going away. The President. Q. Isn't that showing you are out of touch with reality? Q.  The President. It's going away. It's going away. No, it will go away like things go away. Absolutely. It's—— The President. Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible The President. ——no question in my mind it will go away. The President. — Please, go ahead. Q. Yes, Mr. President, you praised—— Q.  The President. Hopefully, sooner rather than later. The President. School Reopening Efforts/Arizona  School Reopening Efforts/Arizona  Q. Mr. President, you praised Governor Ducey's handling of the epidemic in his State. One of the things that he did was delay the start of public schools opening. Is that a model that governors and States experiencing hotspots should—should do as the beginning of school does approach? Q.  The President. Well, I'd like to see the schools open. I think many of the schools—most of the schools will be open. I can say that Republican areas want to see them open, and the Democrats probably want to keep them closed until after November 3 because they think it's good for them politically. I actually don't think it's good for them politically. The President. Parents want the schools open. We want them open. We want them open safely. We're going to practice very strong hygiene and all of the other things that I've enumerated many times. But we want to see the schools open. Yes. Please, go ahead. Q. And, Mr. President, you're encouraging schools—States to follow Governor Ducey's model here. And what part of that model was—— Q.  The President. No, not his model. I just think he's done a very good job. I mean, he's really done a great job. If you look at the numbers, you look at how it's dropped, and very rapidly—he's done a great job. He's a great Governor. The President. Please. School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children  Q. In the interview this morning, Mr. President, you were talking about opening the schools, and you said children are ""virtually immune"" from COVID-19. But children have contracted this virus and some have died from it. Q.  The President. Well, when I say that, I'm talking about from getting very sick. If you look at children, I mean, they're able to throw it off very easily, and it's an amazing thing, because some flus, they don't. They get very sick and they have problems with flus, and they have problems with other things. The President. But for whatever reason, the China virus, children handle it very well. And they may—— Q. [Inaudible]—said ""virtually immune."" Q.  Inaudible The President. ——they may get it, but they get it, and it doesn't have much of an impact on them. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers of—in terms of mortality, fatality, the numbers for children under a certain age, meaning young, their immune systems are very, very strong. They're very powerful, and they—they seem to be able to handle it very well, and that's according to every statistic. The President.  Q. But is it right that they're ""virtually immune""? Q. The President. Yes, please, go ahead. The President. Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West/Presidential Pardons and Commutations  Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West/Presidential Pardons and Commutations  Q. Mr. President, at least two people connected to Kanye West's effort to get on the ballot have been connected to the Republican Party. Is this some—— Q.  The President. Whose—whose ballot? The President. Q. To Kanye West's. Q.  The President. With Kanye West? Oh. The President. Q. He's getting on the ballot, including in swing States. And, as you know, his wife has raised issues about whether he's having mental issues right now. So my question to you is—— Q.  The President. That Kanye West does? I don't know that. Who said that? The President. Q. His wife said he might be going through an episode. Q.  The President. I don't know about that. The President. Q. But anyway, my question to you is—— Q.  The President. I like him. I mean, I like him. He's always been very nice to me. The President. Q. Are you aware of any efforts—— Q.  The President. He's talking about Kanye West. The President. Q. Are you aware of or have you encouraged anyone in the party to help him get on the ballot, including in swing States? Q.  The President. No, not at all. No, not at all, other than I get along with him very well. I like him. I like his wife. His wife recommended certain people, as you know, for—including Alice Johnson, who's a fantastic woman. But his wife recommended certain people to get out of prison. They were in prison for a long time—a long, long time. It should have never happened, and I took what she said very strong—Kim. Kim Kardashian. And, you know, he's got a good heart, very good heart. And I like Kanye very much. No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. The President. Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West  Independent Presidential Candidate Musician Kanye O. West  Q. Do you think it helps you, Mr. President? Q. The President. We'll have to see what happens. We'll see if he gets on the ballot, but—— The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President.——I'm not involved. The President. Q. ——on Beirut. Q.  The President. Please. The President. Airline Industry/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Airline Industry/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you: The group of Republican Senators who are backing $25 billion in payroll assistance to keep the airlines being able to pay their payrolls, do you, you know, endorse that plan? Q.  The President. They're doing what? Republican Senators are doing—— The President. Q. Republican Senators want to go ahead with another $25 billion for airlines to keep their payrolls going. Do you—— Q.  The President. Well, if they need it. Certainly, that's a business—some businesses are doing better than they would normally. Obviously, we know what those businesses are, and obviously, the airline business is not doing very well. You have shutdowns all over the world, and you have airlines that are essentially shut down. Some airlines are doing, you know, modest—best they're doing is modest. I think it's very important that we keep the airlines going. There will be very good times, very soon, I hope. And we don't want to lose our airlines. The President. So if they're looking at that—whether they're Republican or Democrat—I'd be certainly in favor. We can't lose our transportation system. Yes, go ahead. Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Q. I wanted to ask you, too, on Beirut. So there's been some question about your comments yesterday saying that it was an attack and that you'd heard from military officials that there was, you know, an explosion, that it looked like some sort of a bomb. Q.  The President. Well, they don't really know what it was. I can't tell you, whatever happened, it's terrible, but they don't really know what it is. Nobody knows yet. The President. At this moment, they're looking. It could—I mean, how can you say ""accident""? Somebody was—you know, left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around, perhaps. Perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack. I don't think anybody can say right now. We're looking into it very strongly. Right now it's—I mean, you have some people think it was an attack, and you have some people that think it wasn't. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. In any event, it was a terrible event. And a lot of people were killed, and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. And we're standing with that country. You know, we have a very good relationship with that country, but it's a country under—there's a lot of turmoil, a lot of problems, but we stand with them. The President.  Q. One more, Mr. President—— Q Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location  Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. You said earlier today that you are considering using the White House as the venue for your—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——nomination speech. Senator John Thune questioned whether or not that's actually legal, given the Hatch Act. Is this something that you would get clearance for before proceeding? Q.  The President. John Thune did, right? The President. Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible The President. The Republican, John Thune? Oh, okay. Well, it is legal. There is no Hatch Act, because it doesn't pertain to the President. The President. But if I use the White House, we save tremendous amounts of money for the Government, in terms of security, traveling. If we go to another state or some other location, the amount of money is, you know, very enormous, so that's something to consider also. I think it would be a very convenient location. It would be, by far, the least expensive location. There'd be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place. So I think it would be a very convenient idea. It's something that we threw out. It would be very cost-conscious by comparison to any other location. Yes, please. Conservation Efforts/Alaska/Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)  Conservation Efforts/Alaska/Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)  Q. Mr. President, yes—your son, Don Jr., tweeted yesterday asking you to direct the EPA to reject the Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska. It's a giant copper and gold mine. And the thinking is that—— Q.  The President. Rejected in what way? The President. Q. Just reject its construction maybe. The Army Corps of Engineers, 2 weeks ago, suggested it would be okay to proceed with the project, but it would—sportsmen, like your son, are saying that it would be harmful to fisheries. Q.  The President. Well, I'd listen to both sides. I don't know of the argument yet, but I would certainly listen to both sides. My son has some very strong opinions, and he is very much of an environmentalist. And he was very impressed with what we did yesterday, because that's one of the great environmental bills, and beyond that, ever signed since—well, I guess over 100 years, if you think about it. It's been a long time. The President. But I will look at both sides of it. I had heard about it. I will be—I understand they're going to be doing a briefing sometime over the next 48 hours. It's going to go very quickly. I've done a lot for Alaska. I love Alaska. It's a special place. ANWR was one thing. The highway—Cove highway, or whatever the new name is, whatever the old name is. We're getting approvals for a tremendous highway that's been sought for 40 years. They've been trying to get it approved, and I'm getting it approved. We've done a lot for Alaska; it's a special place. And I'll take a look at that. That's interesting. Yes, please, go ahead. Ambulatory First Responders Compensation  Ambulatory First Responders Compensation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two brief questions. First, your administration has praised ambulance drivers and the ambulance service for their role in dealing with the coronavirus. Q.  The President. Sure. The President. Q. And recently, there has been scuttlebutt that the Ambulance Association's drivers and all have not been fully reimbursed for the work they're doing. They said they are owed $2.89 billion and they've only received $300 million from the Provider Relief Fund. Q.  The President. Not $300 billion, no. Not 300—— The President. Q. Million. Q.  The President. Not 300. You mean $300 million? The President. Q. ——at the Provider Relief Fund at HHS. Are you going to look into this or—— Q.  The President. I will. I just heard of it for the first time. The ambulance people have done an incredible job, as have the doctors, the nurses, the frontline workers. Law enforcement has been incredible, the military, FEMA. I mean, I could name almost every group. I can't tell you of a group that's done poorly. But the ambulance people have done a very—it's a tough job too. Very dangerous job. Very tough job. The President. I will certainly look into it. I mean, you're telling me something that—for the first time. Nobody is complaining about not getting paid too much, but we'll take a look at the ambulance drivers. Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Q. The other thing: Secretary Esper said today that, based on what he had heard—the incident in Beirut, he felt, was an accident. Now, he's disagreed with you on other things before. Do you have any comment about his remarks? Q.  The President. Yes, I know. Whatever he—if he—if that's what he heard, I think that—I've heard it both ways too. I've heard ""accident""; I've heard, you know, ""explosives."" And obviously, it must have been some form of explosives. But whether it was a bomb intentionally set off—it ended up being a bomb. But no, I've heard it both ways. It could have been an accident, and it could have also been something that was very offensive. And I wouldn't be very happy with that. The President. Q. And you have no problem with him? Q.  Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon  Q. And just to follow up on that, Mr. President: Even if just have suspicion that the Beirut explosion is a bomb, do you have any plans pertaining to U.S. assets in the region, for example? I mean, how are you looking into this? Q.  The President. We're working very closely with the Government, and we're working very closely with many different agencies, including the military. And we'll be able to figure it out. We already, probably, have figured it out. The President. Thank you very much, everybody. Q. A follow-up, Mr. President. A follow-up? The President. Thank you. Q. The President. ","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1250"
"15","The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey","
          Aug 07, 2020        ","The President. Well, thank you very much. And it's a great honor to have everybody here. And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend. We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight.
 The President.  I want to begin by giving an update on the economy. Economic health is vital to public health. That's why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school. Very important.
 We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May. And I will say that the job growth that we've seen over the last 3 months—9.3 million—is the single greatest 3-month period of job creation in American history. That's big stuff. That's big news and great news.
 Over the past 3 months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs. Over the last 3 months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember: ""You'd need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs""? And we're getting them even in a pandemic—which is disappearing; it's going to disappear.
 And 639,000 brandnew construction jobs. Over half of the new jobs are full-time jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific. Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April. Think of that: 30 percent since April.
 Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent. Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns—incredibly hard—increased by nearly 1 million over the past 3 months, and that's also a record. That's a job record: African American, 1 million. It's job record.
 We must ensure that the progress continues. My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world. So we've contributed $3 trillion.
 My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions; a terrible thing happens with evictions. Not fair. It wasn't their fault that we were infected with this disease from China. And get relief to American families.
 Yet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus. Nothing to do with it at all. So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don't want to help our people.
 If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need. And what we're talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months till the end of the year. And I can extend it at a certain period. Hopefully, I will be here to do the job. We're going to do the job; we've been doing a job like nobody could. Nobody would, actually. And so we're going to have the payroll tax go till the end of the year, and it will be retroactive to July 1. So we're going to go back to July 1, and it will go to the end of the year—payroll tax. At the end of the year, it may be extended. We're going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year. So unemployment benefits will be—that's a big one—will be brought out to the end of the year. And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice—so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they're not even allowed to go back into their colleges. Extend the eviction moratorium—we will be extending that so people aren't evicted. Not their fault.
 We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon. Horrible, horrible event.
 At 3 p.m. this afternoon I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the—are on the way, and they're fully loaded—fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment. Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way. This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time. A horrible event.
 We'll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world. Everyone wants to help. We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help.
 The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come. We're working very closely with their Government and with their leaders.
 And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families—a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought—but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy. We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time. We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
 As you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority. As you know, this is a form of utility. It's been around for a long time, since FDR.
 And the head person—not controlled by Government, but it's sort of semipublic, in a sense—gets paid the highest salary in the world of Government. He gets $8 million a year. That's not a bad amount of money. It's $8 million a year. And we are not accepting that. Even though we're not the ones that appoint him or her—but, in this case, him—we're not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year. This has been going on for many years. And we will do something about that, and we're already in negotiations right now, including possible termination.
 They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers—the workers at the TVA—were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this and on top of the $8 million salary and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year. But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions—these incredible people—in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them. How's that for a law? And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they're getting fired, and they're supposed to train people for a much lower—who get a much lower salary. It's crazy.
 This was a grave injustice. I fired the Chairman of the Board in response. On Friday, I fired the Chairman of the Board, along with one other Board member. That's the one thing we have; we have the right to fire Board members. And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the Board members. And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. And today I'm proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered—great States, great States—that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back. They're being rehired as we speak.
 In this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American, and hire American. You can't do that; you can't fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people. And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they've been there for many years. They've done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA.
 We had a lot of people in the office the other day; a lot of the media was covering it. They love the Tennessee Valley Authority. So—and they're so proud to work for it. But this happened, and it was a terrible thing, so now they're going to get their jobs back—they're all going to be getting their jobs back.
 Nearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus. A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe. Cases continue to surge in Latin America. That's, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world. They have more than doubled in recent days. Latin America is doing very little testing. They're not really equipped to do that. It's tough.
 In the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases. We're doing very well. You don't hear that too often from the media, but we're doing very well. We have a very large country, very complex country, in a sense. More than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. So, if you look at that, more than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. But we have to remain vigilant. We're doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
 Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July. The southern States that were very strong hotspots not long ago—Arizona, Texas, Florida—continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hospital beds.
 Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients. Since mid-June, it's gone—the Governor was up, and we had a great meeting—Governor Ducey. And the meeting was terrific. But since mid-June—so they're doing well, and it's going down—heading down very rapidly, actually.
 Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.
 Florida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease: from 13 percent on July 23, to 8 percent this week. Florida has done very well. It's going down; it's heading down, actually, quite rapidly. And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward. But Florida has done very well.
 Texas has done very well, and rapidly. And Arizona has done incredibly well. So it—Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.
 New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus, the illness. It took a devastating toll on both States, as you know. While both States really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully, we have not seen a resurgence. They've been doing a good job. Everybody is working very hard. Both Governors are working very, very hard. We're in touch with them. We're supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed. But they're needing very little right now. They're in very good shape. We will continue to monitor the new cases.
 Throughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every State—all of our States.
 We're carefully monitoring California's Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. We're carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest. We're watching them all very carefully. It's vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable.
 For this reason, we've delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America. We're focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems. Diabetes is a big problem. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. That's an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
 And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant. They're doing a very good job now. They've really done something that I think is special. They're doing very well, in terms of the virus. They're working very hard. And a lot of things happen—a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard. But the representatives of nursing homes—in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes—they're working very hard.
 The Federal Government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone. Think of that. We've provided $3.4 billion to the State of New Jersey in emergency relief funding. So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers. The Governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job. We're working very closely with him. We've also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and health care facilities.
 And through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses. A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they're there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.
 On therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials. This would be years ahead of schedule. We have done wonders with the FDA. I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn. But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about.
 Today Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead's drug, remdesivir, where we've had tremendous success. Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what's going on. And if you can go to a blood bank—if you've had this disease and beat it, and there are a lot of people that have—if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.
 The United States is only 5 percent of the world's population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world's testing. Think of that: 5 percent, and we've given 25 percent of the world's testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we're constantly showing cases, cases, cases; cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up, because we're doing—one of the reasons—we're doing a lot of testing.
 We're doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing. They'll test people if they get sick. They'll test people if they go into the hospital. They'll test certain people. We're doing tremendous testing. And we're especially doing big testing at the nursing homes.
 Over the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples. And we've also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests. Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we're very focused on and doing. But, in the not-too-distant future, we'll have so many tests where it's a quick test—they call it a ""quick test""—5 minutes to 15 minutes. So we won't even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving. Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let's say, a day at the laboratory—that's 3 days right there. And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.
 Over the next 2 weeks, I'll be pursuing a major Executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor—we have to cover preexisting conditions. So we will be pursuing a major Executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all of its customers.
 This has never been done before, but it's time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.
 This follows a series of Executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices—and significantly. We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years. But we're talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that's usually a reason—they're not happy. They can't be too thrilled. But they've made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up. Not fair.
 This includes a landmark Executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans—and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. That means our country can't be charged more.
 So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we're paying many times that price in the United States—because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things—we will get what's called a ""favored nations clause."" We're going to have—and I signed a favored nations clause so that the United States—which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world—biggest purchaser in the world, not even close. You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera. Not too many. But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs. We're the number-one country in the world.
 But we have a favored nation—so if somebody has a drug—in many cases, it comes from a plant—the same plant. It comes from—it's the same pill; it's the same medicine or medication. Whatever the lowest country charges—so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill and we charge $2—and I only use Germany as an example—then we get that for 10 cents. So what's going to happen is, that's going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot. So it's the favored nations. And I will tell you that Big Pharma is not happy. For too long, we've been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries. We've subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe. Nobody talked about it. Everybody wondered: ""How come every President that runs for office says they're going to lower drug prices, and they never do? They go through the right—roof."" Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing—skyrocketing. That's Biden. Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it. He has no clue. [Laughter]
 Laughter So what's happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands. And we're going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators—those benefits are going to go to our people. So it's called a ""favored nations clause,"" and you can look it up, and you can see. And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it's a very big step. But it's something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent. We're talking about numbers that are unbelievable.
 I also signed an Executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves. These are some of the richest people in the world. Everyone talked about middlemen. I've heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices—middlemen. I guess you'd have to say to be politically correct, ""middle men and women."" But you never heard the ""middlewomen"" before; you heard ""middlemen."" That's the term.
 And you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product. They produce the pill. They produce the medicine—the medication. But these people make billions and billions of dollars. I don't know who they are, but they're very rich. But they won't be so rich anymore.
 This Executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients. So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I'm going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. [Laughter]
 Laughter On opioids, I'm pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America. In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic. And we've done very well. We've done—it was prior to the virus—we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent. But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that's not acceptable.
 The wall is going up. We have 276 miles of wall. It's having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already. It will be finished toward the end of the year. And it's had a very, very big impact.
 On Portland: Finally, I'd like to address that situation. Portland is a disaster. It's been a disaster for many, many years. Brave Federal law enforcement officers singlehandedly—the officers, they singlehandedly saved the Federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists—and that's what they are. You know, when you find Molotov cocktails in somebody's knapsack, and they say, ""No, I'm just here to have a good time."" [Laughter] These are really sick, disturbed people.
 Laughter The disgraced mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob. He was at the mercy of the mob too. If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible. He went out there, and they wanted to rip him apart. But fortunately, he had five people with him called ""security.""
 Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob. As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down, an act of attempted murder. Left-swing, violent extremism poses an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it. You have no idea how much we stop, but it's an ideology we have to stop.
 ""When you commit arson""—this is a quote from the mayor; he's come a long way. He just made this quote. ""When you commit arson with an accelerant in the attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who have intentionally been trapped inside, you are not a"" demonstrator—or ""you're not demonstrating,"" said, Mayor Wheeler, ""You are attempting to commit murder."" That's come a long way; he's come a long way when he made that statement.
 What you're seeing in Portland is the radical left's agenda in action. Portland is their roadmap for America. If the radical left gets in—and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet; he's merely a puppet. But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want. That's what they want. Why? Who knows? Doesn't matter. It's a different thinking, but it's a mess.
 And I want to thank Homeland Security. They've done a fantastic job. We had our people go in. They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse, and the courthouse was saved, and other Federal buildings were saved. And we would like to be asked by the mayor and the Governor—we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours, just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city. But the National Guard went in, did a phenomenal job.
 It was over in 3 hours. After watching 6 days of horror, it ended in 3 hours. You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street, just to—it was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things.
 So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately, but we are supposed to be asked. If we're not asked and if it continues, we'll have to make a decision. But it's a very easy thing for us to do. We could stop it very quickly. It's been going on now for 76 days. But our buildings are very secure.
 If the Democrats controlled in Washington—the Democrats' control of Washington—they'd pass—with all of the things they do—legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do; many of these people want to defund the police department. At a minimum, they're going to stop money from going to the police department, but in many cases they actually wanted to defund, completely, the police department.
 No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster. They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we're waiting for the mayor. We've sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we're waiting for them to call—the Governor, the mayor. We could do a very good job in Chicago. Nobody's ever seen anything like that—this country.
 And yet, nationwide numbers are good, despite the Chicagos and the Portlands—and frankly, the New Yorks, when you look at what's happened in New York. Three hundred and forty-eight percent increase in the last number of months. Nobody has seen anything like that. It's so sad. To me, it's so sad, because I love New York. And it's so sad. And it—all it is, is horrible, horrible incompetent management by politicians that truly don't know what they're doing.
 So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America. And a vast majority of people agree with me. A vast majority. Most people. They don't speak up as much as they could, but we know they're there, and everybody else knows they're there too.
 So, with that, I'll take a few questions from the media. They've been here for a long time, and they've been waiting outside for a long time. And they wait for these moments. So it was a lot of fun. [Laughter]
 Laughter Please, go ahead. Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief 
 Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  The President. No. You, go ahead.
 The President.  Q. Me? Oh, thank you, Mr. President. I have a couple of questions on the negotiations with Capitol Hill and the——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President.  Q. ——coronavirus legislation. These Executive orders you mention, do you have a timeline on when you're going to sign them or——
 Q.  The President. Yes, it could be by the end of the week. They're being drawn by the lawyers right now. They work very nicely. It would be nice to be able to do it with the Democrats, but they're really just interested in one thing, and that's protecting people that have not done a good job in managing cities and States. And nothing to do with COVID, nothing to do with—or little to do. They want to be able to make up for many, many years—in some cases, decades—of bad management. We can't do that.
 The President.  So that's what they want. They want to do that, and we don't want to do that.
 Q. Are you concerned that—about the legality of these Executive orders?
 Q.  The President. No, not at all.
 The President.  Q. Because there are questions they may be found illegal.
 Q.  The President. No. If somebody—well, you always get sued. I mean, everything you do you get sued. I was sued on the travel ban, and we won. I was sued on a lot of things, and we won. So we'll see. Yes, probably, we get sued, but people feel that we can do it.
 The President.  Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.
 Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations/Iran/North Korea/National Economy 
 Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations/Iran/North Korea/National Economy  Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, the intelligence agencies today said that Russia is already meddling in this year's election to hurt Joe Biden, and that China is considering meddling to hurt you. Do you believe that intelligence? And what do you plan to do about it?
 Q.  The President. It could be. I mean, it could be—very much. I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.
 The President.  Q. That's not what the intelligence is showing though.
 Q.  The President. Well, I don't care what anybody says. Nobody with any common sense would say, do—look at what we've done with our military. Look at what we've done in exposing the pipeline with billions of dollars going to Russia. Look at all of the things we've done with NATO, where I've raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent, and now they're paying all of this money. And the 130, by the way—$130 billion—not ""million,"" ""billion""—goes to $400 billion over a few years. And that's all money to protect against Russia.
 The President.  China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to Sleepy Joe Biden. They would dream—they would own our country. [Laughter] If Joe Biden was President, China would own our country. And you said another country? What was the third country?
 Laughter Q. No, just those two. And do you—— The President. No, no. You didn't—you didn't say then the report. The report said Iran, also. But you didn't say that.
 Q.  The President.  Q. I didn't say that.
 Q.  The President. Iran would love to see me—Iran would love to see me not be President. And I'll make the statement: If and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly. We'll make deals with North Korea very quickly.
 The President.  And whatever happened to the word ""North Korea""? You haven't seen that, have you? If I didn't win the election in 2016, our country would now be—maybe it would be over by now, but in war with North Korea. Everybody said, ""Oh, Trump will get us in war."" No, it's just the opposite.
 And we actually have a relationship with North Korea, which is something that—it was never established by the previous administration. You would have been in war with North Korea, and it would have been a very bad war.
 So North Korea—whether you look at Iran—every one of them will make a deal with us very quickly. Iran is dying to make a deal, but they want to see, because they'd much rather make a deal with Biden. Because if they make a deal with the United States, if China makes a deal with the United States with Biden in charge, they would own our country.
 Look what I've done. I've taken billions—tens of billions of dollars from China. China was having the worst year they've had in 67 years, and we were having the best year we've ever had—with big tax cuts, with big regulation cuts. We've rebuilt our military. We became independent in terms of energy. We're the energy leader of the world. We were having the best year we've ever had.
 By the way, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American unemployment numbers—the best in the history of our country. All things—and many other groups too—including women; including high school diploma, no high school diploma, college diploma. Everybody was doing better.
 The last thing that Russia wants and China wants and Iran wants would be for Donald Trump to win.
 Yes, please. Go ahead.
 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks 
 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Potential Voter Fraud Risks  Q. Just to follow up, what do you plan to do about that interference, sir?
 Q.  The President. Well, we're going to look at it very closely. You're telling me that this came out a little while ago, and I've heard that it came out. It came out just a little while ago, and we're going to look at that very closely.
 The President.  But you started off with Russia.
 Q. Russia on——
 Q.  The President. Why don't you start off with China? Do you think China is may be a bigger threat? I mean, I think maybe it is. I mean, you'll have to figure it out. But we're going to watch all of them. We have to be very careful.
 The President.  The biggest risk that we have is mail-in ballots, because with the mail-in ballots—it's called ""universal mail-in ballots""—it's much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it's Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, many others, people—countries you wouldn't expect—it's much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in. It's much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots.
 So I think one of the things we'll have to look at is exactly that, but that's a big problem. That's a big problem. And you saw, in New York, they called the winner, but they have no idea what the vote is.
 Please, go ahead.
 Coronavirus Relief Legislation/2020 Presidential Election 
 Coronavirus Relief Legislation/2020 Presidential Election  Q. Mr. President, we've watched these negotiations go on for weeks. Do you think if you had been more directly involved, we would be in a different position than we are today?
 Q.  The President. No, I'm totally involved. No, I—they call me all the time. They tell me how they're doing with Nancy and Chuck. But in my opinion, they're just using it as an excuse to try and—you know, Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it's good for the economy, but he has—he doesn't do it. He doesn't practice what he preaches.
 The President.  No, my people—Steve Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows—they're constantly on the phone with me. I'm totally involved with it. And we are going to do it in a way that's just much easier. We gave them their chance, but they view it as an election enhancement.
 You know, you talk about foreign countries cheating on the election. Well, the Democrats are cheating on the election, because that's exactly what they're doing. If you look at what they're doing, even with these negotiations, that's an influence and an unfair influence on an election. But we're going to win anyway.
 Yes. Please go ahead.
 Q. Mr. President, when was the last time your spoke to Speaker Pelosi though? We're at this historic moment. Why haven't you spoken to her?
 Q.  The President. Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens, but right now they're not ready. And they're not ready because, frankly, I don't think they care about people. I think they care about their politicians that have done a terrible job running the cities and States—Democrat cities and States—that are bleeding money, that have been so badly run.
 The President.  You take a look at Baltimore, and you take a look at so many different cities, including the ones I've already mentioned. Take a look at what's going on. And they want lots of money to keep it going. For many years, they've been bad.
 So all I'm doing is, we're having it out. We're finally having it out.
 Yes, please.
 Coronavirus Relief Legislation 
 Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, if you go ahead on your own on unemployment insurance, I'm wondering both where you're going to get the money to pay for that without Congress and will people still get $600 a week?
 Q.  The President. Yes, we have the money. We have the money. Yes.
 The President.  Q. They'll still get $600 a week, in addition?
 Q.  The President. I won't say that yet. You'll see that when it happens, but we have the money.
 The President.  Q. Will you say what number they would—— The President. We have it, Justin [Justin Sink, Bloomberg News]. We have plenty of money.
 Q.  The President.  Yes. Please go ahead.
 Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Potential Interference in 2020 Presidential Election 
 Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Potential Interference in 2020 Presidential Election  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said that the pandemic is disappearing, but we lost 6,000 Americans this week. And just in this room, you have dozens of people who are not following the guidelines in New Jersey which say you should not have more than 25 people——
 Q.  The President. No, they don't have to. This is a political activity.
 The President.  Audience members. Booo!
 Audience members.  Q. So why are you setting a—why are you setting such a bad example, Mr. President, for the country?
 Q.  The President. Yes. You're wrong on that, because it's a political activity. They have exceptions. Political activity.
 The President.  Q. [Inaudible]
 Q.  Inaudible The President. And it's also a peaceful protest. [Laughter] So when you have an—and as you know—it's a peaceful protest. They asked if they could be here.
 The President.  Laughter You know, they—a number of—and, to me, they look like they all have—pretty much all have masks on. But you know, you have an exclusion in the law. It says ""peaceful protest"" or ""political activity,"" right? In fact, specifically—yes. It says—exactly—""political activity"" or ""peaceful protests.""
 And you can call it ""political activity,"" but I'd call it ""peaceful protests"" because they heard you were coming up. And they know the news is fake. They understand it better than anybody.
 Audience members. Yes! [Applause]
 Audience members.  Applause The President. They asked whether or not—they asked whether or not they could be here. Like the question about Russia. He doesn't mention Iran was in the report. He doesn't mention—or he mentions very late that China was in the report——
 The President.  Audience member. China wants Biden!
 Audience member.  The President. ——because that's the way they are. They're not——
 The President.  If the press in this country were honest, if it wasn't corrupt, if it wasn't fake, our country would be so much further ahead. But we're doing really great. [Applause]
 Applause Thank you all very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey"
"16","The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey","
          Aug 08, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, and good afternoon. My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief. The President. Already, my administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief, saving many tens of millions of dollars and jobs. And you see how fast the economy is coming back. It does look like it's going to be a very sharp ""V."" We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth. We set a record on number of jobs in the last 3 months. It's the most jobs ever created in a 3 month period—during a 3 month period. That's great. Before we begin, I've just signed two bills that are great for our vets. Our vets are very special. We passed choice, as you know—Veterans Choice—and Veterans Accountability. And they've been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no President has ever been able to do it. And we got it done so veterans have choice. And now you have accountability—that if you don't love your vets, if you're in the VA and you don't love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don't do your job. We want people that love our vets. The first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and—in particular, blindness in both eyes. And we have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we're doing something about it. They've been talking about this for many years. So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. Okay? Second is—requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes. And you know what that all means, and it's really something that they've been trying to get done for a long time. The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court. So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes. Okay? I think it's self-explanatory. We've wanted this for a long time, they've been trying to get it for a long time, and now we have it. And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done. We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA. In the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families. Democrats have refused these offers; they want to negotiate. What they really want is bailout money for States that are run by Democrat Governors and mayors and that have been run very badly for many, many years and many decades, in fact. You know the States; everybody knows who we're talking about and what we're talking about. I don't think we have to go over it. But what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money. It has nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing to do with anything that we've been talking about over the last period of time. They want to bailout States that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years and, in fact, in all cases, many decades. And we're not willing to do that. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical-left Democrats, and we just can't do that. So, hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date, but we're going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation as we know it and as you have been covering it in some cases, actually covering it accurately. Many of the far-left policies they're pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard, namely, the corona. You can call it so many different names. What a horrible thing China released upon the world. One third of their bill—the Heroes Act—is spending completely unrelated money to the virus. Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme-left bill. And, again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party. And, in fact, he's gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going. So, obviously, other than Bernie have brought him left. If you look at the manifesto that they've agreed to, it's far further left than I've ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders. The massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue States we talked about; that's one of the things they're looking to do. Measures designed to increase voter fraud. Banning voter ID; they want to ban voter ID. We should have voter ID in every State. Every State should have voter ID. You have ID on everything you do, practically, yet every—everybody has voter ID. Everybody has ID except for voters. When you vote, you don't want ID; they don't want. We have some States with it; it works out great. And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID. They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all States and banning requirements for signature verification in Federal elections. Now, why would they want, in this bill—which really has nothing to do with what we're talking about: stimulus—something banning voter ID? In every single State, they want to ban it, including States where we already have it, because we have some States where we have it: Indiana and others that do very well. Why would they want to ban voter ID in all States? And why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in Federal election? Who would want a bill banning signature verification? What's that all about? You know what it's about? Fraud. That's what they want: fraud. They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it's the only way they can win the election. The bill also requires all States to do universal mail-in balloting—which nobody is prepared for—regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. They want to steal an election. That's all this is all about: They want to steal the election. So, in the bill, they have a bill that requires all States to do universal mail-in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. Like in Nevada, it's such a disaster. Their infrastructure is a total disaster. They don't want to have signature verification, they don't want to have any of the safeguards that you need, and they don't want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic and even other States that we disagree with have. This Nevada thing is a mess, but we'll see how the courts determine—what the courts determine. But they certainly don't have the infrastructure in Nevada. So we'll see how it is. As you know, we brought suit last week, and we'll see how that all works out. I think we're going to win it. But basically, what they're trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification: They're trying to steal an election. And I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last 4 or 5 days. And if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they've never seen anything like it, and they haven't seen anything like it. And the press doesn't report it because they're fake news. [Laughter] Laughter They even want to force States to implement the controversial practice known as ""ballot harvesting""—a very dangerous practice—meaning they would allow Democrat Party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the post office without any verification of who filled them out, including a verification of signatures on the ballot. So you're not even going to have a verified signature. Anybody—I could sign it. You could sign it. Anybody in this room could sign it. And that's going to count as a vote. How can you do a thing like this? So this is what they're asking for. This is what Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer are asking for. [Laughter] Okay? It's ridiculous. It's horrible. It's a horrible thing. Laughter The Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. So if you were able to get into our country illegally—and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now. We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles. And we'll be completed with it around the end of the year. We're going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn't realize were so bad, so we'll be completed with it. Right after, we're going to do the additional mileage. We'll do it probably a little bit after the year. I think, from what I've heard, Joe Biden—Sleepy Joe—wants to rip the wall down. He wants people to pour into our country. They want to have open borders. We don't want to have open borders. So the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons. How do you like that one? And this is in the bill that we're talking about? What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy? What does this have to do with the coronavirus? Another name. What does this have to do with this? So think of that: They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. What does this have to do with what we're trying to do? They want to put this—and this is a radical-left policy so they can go to Portland and try and rip the place apart that they've been doing for many years and they've been doing for years and years. They also compel the mass release of inmates. What does this have to do with what we're talking about? This is Nancy Pelosi—Crazy Nancy—and Chuck Schumer. They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we're talking about, and it includes serious felons. They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons. That's page 1,689; page 1,762. Think of it: 1,762. And that's nowhere near the end of their bill. They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read. These people—I don't—I honestly don't believe they love our country, if you want to know the truth. In addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures: support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to help millions of workers on the payroll. This is a great program. Very successful. Kept a lot of businesses open. That's why we're doing so well in reopening our country. Additional money for hospitals. Testing and vaccines. Direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four. Now, remember, this is what the extreme partisans—this—we've got—we have to—this is what we're talking about. Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want. And what we want is good for people. Those—these are things that they're blocking: support for K-12 schools, so they can open. Think of that. Also, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four-plus, then funding for childcare and mental health care. And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown. You need that: mental health care. Funding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest hit communities, including rural communities and farmers. They don't want anybody to get that. Democrats are obstructing all of it. Therefore, I'm taking Executive action. We've had it. And we're going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers, and I'll be signing these bills in a very short period of time. First one is on providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year. In a few moments, I will sign a directive, instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1. And we're actually going to be making that; we just got the word. We're just getting some word from a lot of people. We didn't think we'd have to do this, because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they've been not only unreasonable, they've been ridiculous. So we're going to make that August 1, most likely. It'll be August 1. We'll let you know the exact date, but we're looking like August 1. So it'd be August 1 through the end of 2020. This will mean bigger paychecks for working families, as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all. And we're doing very good with the numbers. You see it's going down in Arizona very, very substantially and rapidly, going down in California, going down in Texas, going down in Florida. Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we're watching them very closely. We understand the disease, and we're watching them very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens' residences. If I'm victorious on November 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I'm going to make them all permanent. Now, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that. They don't want that, because they're adding $3 trillion in taxes. So they'll have the option of raising everybody's taxes and taking this away. But if I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I'll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax. And so, we'll see what happens. Biden probably won't be doing that; you'll have to ask him. I don't think he knows what he's doing. [Laughter] Laughter Second, I'm signing an Executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and CDC to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes. So I'm protecting people from eviction. Yet you've been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don't want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction. I said: ""Let's do that separately. That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live."" And they didn't even want to protect people from eviction. So they would get evicted—it's not their fault that this virus came into our country; it's China's fault. And came into the world—by the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the States that were doing the best are having some problems. A lot of the States that we weren't thinking were doing the best are doing very well. You look at some of the countries involved. Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding. But they'll get it down; they understand it. We're dealing with them. We're dealing with a lot of countries. We're providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now. We make a lot of ventilators. We started off with very little, and we're making a lot. And we have thousands in our stockpile, but we're making thousands a month. And we're providing many of them—thousands and thousands—to other countries that would never be able to get them. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their homes. So we don't want people being evicted. And the bill—the act that I'm signing will solve that problem, largely—hopefully, completely. The third action I'm taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed expanded unemployment benefits into law. Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief. They even oppose measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job. They were totally opposed to that. For this reason, I'm taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits: $400. Okay? So that's generous, but we want to take care of our people. Again, it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault. States will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund. Under this plan, States will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the Federal Government will cover 75 percent of the cost. So we're all set up. It's $400 per week. And we're doing that without the Democrats. We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people. Fourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers. Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero. I don't know if people know that because the press doesn't ever report it, but maybe they're watching now. [Laughter] The press doesn't report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country. Laughter Earlier this year, we slashed student loans' interest rates to zero percent and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30. Today I'm extending this policy through the end of the year, and we'll extend it further than that, most likely, right after December 1. So we look like we're going to be extending that. They're paying zero interest. And again, not their fault that their colleges are closed down and not their fault that they're unable to get what they bargained for. Through these four actions, my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time. And the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we're now coming back and setting records. We'll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead. And with the $400 and all of the other measures that we're talking about and will be signing in a little while, that will happen. We're further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts. So we're going to be looking at that—capital gains—for the purpose of creating jobs, and income tax is self-explanatory. And it'll be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people, because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality. I'm saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality. So we're going to be looking at income tax, and we're going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both and maybe substantial. And we'll be reporting back fairly shortly on that. That's big news. That's big news, but very important. We want to have our jobs flourish. We want to have our companies do great. We want to have the 401(k)s, which are now at a level—if you look at the stock market, it's great. If you have stocks in NASDAQ, you're higher than you ever were, including even—this is still during the pandemic. The stock market—because they see such incredible things are happening, smart people—the stock market is that almost an alltime high. We're just short of it. And NASDAQ is higher than it ever was. It's broken the record 14 times in the last couple of months. So 401(k)s are doing fantastically. I hope you kept your stocks. I hope you didn't sell. I hope you had confidence in your President and confidence that your President was going to be reelected. And I will tell you this, that the biggest tailwind, the biggest problem that we have, with respect to the stock market—which is not much of a problem because it's doing so well, but it would be actually much higher—is the possibility that these radical-left Democrats could win. And if they win, we're going to have a crash. We're going to have a terrible problem, because they're going to raise taxes: 3 trillion dollars' worth of taxes. And that's going to affect everybody from middle income to upper income, to jobs, to companies. Your 401(k)s will go down like a rock. Your stocks will go down like a rock. You know, and don't forget: These big companies—you have stocks in these companies. You know, you own stocks. And they have millions and millions of shareholders. And whether it's pension funds or anybody else, you all have stocks. So there are big companies, but a lot of people own that stock, and we want to keep it going. But we do have, I guess you could say, not a tailwind; it's a headwind—I guess would be a better description. But it is; it's a headwind. And when you think of it, that's—in my opinion, it would be much higher. But you look at what they want to do. They want to raise everybody's taxes—everybody. And they want to do the Green New Deal, which will decimate our country and decimate—it's ridiculous too. It's childish. I actually say the Green New Deal is childish. It's for children. It's not for adults. [Laughter] Laughter Anybody that believes in that is—I don't know, maybe it's politics. I don't even think it's good politics. They seem to think so. We'll see how they do. But I don't think it's good politics, and it will decimate our economy. We've learned a great deal about this virus and how to treat it. Our strategy is to aggressively shield those at the greatest risk while allowing younger and healthier citizens to safely resume work and school. I noticed that some of the Democrats that I would say are very strongly on the left are now coming out and saying we really have to open our schools for the good of the economy. I was shocked to see a couple of them; you know they are. We urge all Americans to socially distance and avoid large crowds and all of the things that we talk about all the time. We have to go and make sure that everything is in good shape. We really are: We're coming back very, very strong. We're doing very well with the virus, because all of those States that everybody thought would be in a bad position for a long time, they're all coming down. Governors have done a great job. Don't forget, we're dealing with Governors. Some have done a fantastic job. All have worked hard. Some have done a much better job than others. And someday, if you'd like to know, I'll give you the good ones and the bad ones. We'll give you some good ones and some bad ones. But, by contrast, the never-ending lockdown being proposed by some, mostly—I guess you could almost say ""almost all""—in the Democrat Party, would inflict unimaginable harm to our people and to our health for decades to come. It'll hurt our economy, and they view that as a good thing. They actually view that as a good thing because they're interested in one date: November 3. And I actually think it's bad politics, and I think they're starting to come along, because I'm seeing more and more people want to open up. And you see the devastating results of lockdowns, too. You know, you have depression and suicide and drugs and alcohol and bad marriages. Marriages that were very good turned out to be very bad. [Laughter] Laughter It's an amazing thing, and it's—who would think it? But people get along for 20 years; I guess they didn't know each other very well, and now they're not getting along. [Laughter] And you had the opposite, also. You've had people to get along better. They like each other more than they thought. That's okay too. [Laughter] That, we like. But the other situation is very, very—very, very bad. Laughter Laughter We'll develop a vaccine. We're going to have it very soon, and we're ready to distribute it. And we're got the military ready. ""Logistics,"" it's called. And we'll end this pandemic, and we will rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world. You know, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world—the highest stock market ever. And we're very close to getting that back. That, I have to say, is way ahead of schedule. Highest stock market ever. Best employment numbers for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans. And by the way, Hispanic Americans just set a record for new jobs. African Americans just set a record for new jobs just now, during the pandemic, the last month. And Asian Americans just set a record for new jobs. So we're very proud of what's happening. And I will now sign the Executive action. And then, if you want, we can ask a few questions. Okay, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. Yes, let me do this first, and then you can do some questions. Thank you very much. Okay, good. Okay, so this is for the authorization of other needs assistance program, major disasters declaration related to the coronavirus disease. Okay? [At this point, the President signed the memorandum.] At this point, the President signed the memorandum. So this—authority invested in me—this is the payment relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. [The President signed the memorandum.] The President signed the memorandum. This is fighting the spread of the COVID-19 by providing assistance to renters and homeowners. We're doing assistance. [The President signed the Executive order.] The President signed the Executive order. And this is deferral payroll tax obligations. So this is your payroll tax obligations, which we're going to end up terminating eventually, right? [The President signed a third memorandum.] The President signed a third memorandum. How many pictures can you take over there? [Laughter] I mean, you're taking hundreds of pictures. What are you doing? Okay. Laughter Q. Can you get at the microphone, sir? Q.  The President. I will. I will. The President. So that's the story. Would anybody like a pen? Would anybody like a pen? Would anybody—— Audience member. I do! Audience member. The President. Why do we hand these—we'll hand these out to you in the back. Okay, fine. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Yes, please. The President. Executive Action on Unemployment Insurance  Executive Action on Unemployment Insurance  Q. Yes, sir. Can we start with the $400, sir? So I just wanted to get your reaction. So you're saying the States will have to cover some of the costs, sir. Which Governors have told you that—which Governors have told you that they would sign onto it? Q.  The President. Well, if they don't, they don't. That's up to them. But if they don't, they don't. That's going to be their problem. I don't think their people will be too happy. They have the money. So I don't think their people will be too happy. But if they don't, they don't. The President. But again, the States have the money. It's sitting there. All right, Kelly. Executive Action on Unemployment Insurance  Executive Action on Unemployment Insurance  Q. Sir, why did you decide on $400, when previously families were receiving $600? Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. That will be a hardship for many. What do you say to them? Q.  The President. Well, no, it's not a hardship. This is the money that they need, this is the money they want, and this gives them a great incentive to go back to work. The President. So this was much more than was originally agreed. The $600 was a number that was there. And as you know, they were diff—there was difficulty with the $600 number because it really was a disincentive. Yes. Go ahead, please. Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Q. Payroll Tax Cut  Payroll Tax Cut  Q. Sir, the payroll tax cut was opposed by both parties on Capitol Hill. Can you give your rationale as to why you think that's important, particularly since it doesn't help Americans who—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible The President. Yes. Okay. It helps people greatly. It helps our country get back. And anybody that would say anything different, I think, is very foolish. Everybody wanted it. By the way, the Democrats want it. The Republicans want it. They just couldn't get it—they just couldn't come to an agreement, but everybody wants it. The President. And the very important thing is, the people want it, and the people need it, actually. Q. Mr. President—— The President. Yes. Yes. Q.  The President. Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Q. Mr. President, you said that this will pretty much take care of the entire situation. But, as you said, there's not money for reopening schools, other important items. Is your administration willing to go back to Democrats to try to actually negotiate some of these big things? Q.  The President. Well, the answer is yes, but we have money to do other things, and we have a lot of money that was unspent, and we'll be able to do things with the money that was unspent. We have significant money that was unspent, and we will be able to use that for different purposes. The President. Go ahead. Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President. Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Q. Mr. President, when will this relief get in the hands of Americans that need it? What date? Q.  The President. We think it's going to be very rapid. We want it to be very rapid. It's going to be distributed in a way that—whichever the fastest way. There are various methods, and it will be rapidly distributed. The President. Q. But you said you're also expecting legal challenges with this, right? So why—— Q.  The President. I didn't say that. No, no. I didn't say that. The President. Q. Yes, you did. Yesterday, sir, you said that you were expecting legal hurdles—— Q.  The President. I said—what I said is, people can do whatever they want. I guess maybe they'll bring legal actions; maybe they won't, but they won't win. They won't win. The President. Q. But if legal action is brought against you on this, why not just work with Congress on this deal? Q.  The President. Well, I'm not saying they're not going to come back and negotiate. They might very well come back and negotiate. The President. Q. But you're signing the Executive order today, and Americans want to know when they're going to see this relief. What date will they see it? Q.  The President. Very soon. They're going to see it very soon. Look, it's—— The President. Q. Very soon? Q.  The President. There it is. Right there. The President. Q. Thirty million Americans are out of work, sir. Q.  The President. Excuse me. Excuse me. There it is, right there. The President. Go ahead. Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief  Q. Mr. President, though, this is expected to be tied up in the court. So this relief is either going to be delayed or blocked indefinitely. Q.  The President. Oh, I don't think so. Q. Is this just political theater? The President. Q.  The President. I think this is going to go very rapidly through the courts. The President. Q. But are you giving people false hope? Q.  The President. This will go very—if we get sued. Maybe we won't get sued. If we get sued, it's somebody that doesn't want people to get money. Okay? And that's not going to be a very popular thing. The President. Q. But should a President be able to go around Congress? Are you trying to set a new precedent—— Q.  The President. No. No. The President. Q. ——that the President can go around Congress and decide how money is collected and spent? Q. —— The President. You ever hear the word ""obstruction""? The President. Q. Yes. You were investigated for that. Q.  The President. They've obstructed. Congress has obstructed. The Democrats have obstructed people from getting desperately needed money. The President. Q. But this is in the Constitution, Mr. President. Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. Right here. The President. Q. Mr. President, sir—— Q.  Q. Why do you keep saying that you passed Veterans—— Q.  The President. No, no. You're finished. [Laughter] The President. Laughter Go ahead, please. Please. Go ahead. Q. [Inaudible]—Veterans Choice? It was passed in 2014. Q.  Inaudible The President. Okay, excuse me. The President. Go ahead, please. Q. But it's a false statement, sir. Q.  The President. Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. The President.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey-0"
"17","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 10, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. I thought I'd start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed—just the news. Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the State of Virginia, including to many dead people. This was an unprecedented mailing flub that's heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts. It's a disaster: all over Virginia, half a million votes. So that's something you have to think about. The President. We don't want to have a rigged election, I know that. And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system. And when you have this mail-in voting, it's a—it's very susceptible. It's something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans. And I think that it's something you have to start thinking about very seriously. Our system is not equipped for it. The Post Office is not equipped for it. And people should vote, like they did in World War I and World War II. And your numbers will be—in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think—much better—on the coronavirus or the China virus. But it's something you have to look about—look at and say, ""This is just crazy."" This just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the State of Virginia to many people that weren't living. They had some sent to pets, dogs. This is what we're going to get into, and it's going to be a disaster. And it's going to be thought of very poorly, and it's going to hurt our country. After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement—we're pro-jobs, pro-health safety—Executive orders—the stock market went up 358 points today. So we—we issued those Executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today. It's quite a reaction. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March—50 percent. Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent. The NASDAQ index continues to set new records. It's been up over 14 times; new record in NASDAQ. And the S&P 500 and the Dow—Dow Jones are going to be—I mean, the way they're going, it looks like they're just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon. Secret Service agent. Sir, we're just going to have to step out in the hall—[inaudible]. Secret Service agent. inaudible The President. Excuse me? The President. Secret Service agent. We will step out outside. Secret Service agent. Q. What's going on, Mr. President? Q.  The President. Oh. Excuse me. The President. [At this point, the President was escorted out of the room. Then, the President returned, and the press briefing resumed.] At this point, the President was escorted out of the room. Then, the President returned, and the press briefing resumed. The President. So thank you very much. Sorry for that. The—there was a shooting outside of the White House, and it seems to be very well under control. I'd like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work. But there was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don't know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service. So we'll see what happens. The President. And yes, did you have something? Go ahead. Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Mr. President, do you have any details about the shooting? Were they targeting anyone in and around the White House? Q.  The President. No, we—there are no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they'll have details for you in a little while. The President. Somebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. And this just took place. A couple of people outside—I noticed a man named John Roberts [Fox News], who you know very well—— The President.  Q. Yes. Q.  The President. ——he reported that he heard shots. He was outside, and he heard two shots. The President.  Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Mr. President, was this a threat toward you, sir? Q.  The President. We don't know yet. We don't know. They're going to find that out. The President. Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Do you know if the individual said anything, sir—— Q.  The President. We don't know that, yet. No. The President. Q. ——or mentioned your name, anything like that? Q.  The President. We don't know that yet. The President. Q. And you can confirm it was the Secret Service that did shoot the suspect? Q.  The President. It seems to be. Yes. The President. Q. It seems to be. Q.  The President. It seems to be. The President. The President's Location During His Absence From the Briefing Room  The President's Location During His Absence From the Briefing Room  Q. Where were you taken, Mr. President? Were you taken to the bunker? Q.  The President. No, we were taken just out over to the Oval Office. The President. Shooting Outside of the White House/U.S. Secret Service  Shooting Outside of the White House/U.S. Secret Service  Q. What did Secret Service tell you when you were outside of the room? Q.  The President. Just told me, when he came up—you pretty much saw it like I did—he said, ""Sir, could you please come with me?"" So you were surprised. I was surprised, also. I think it's probably pretty unusual. But very, very professional people. They do a fantastic job, as you know. So it seems to me—it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was law enforcement shot someone—seems to be the suspect—and the suspect is now on the way to the hospital. I can't tell you the condition of the suspect. The President. Q. Was the suspect armed? Was the suspect armed? Q. The President. There was nobody else injured. There was no other law enforcement injured. And I just want to—and we'll get on to the press conference, but I do want to thank Secret Service. They are fantastic, the job they do. The President.  Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Mr. President, was the suspect armed? Do you know? Was he armed? Q.  The President. From what I understand, the answer is yes. The President. Q. He was armed, Mr. President? Q.  The President. That's what I understand. I don't know. You'll have to ask them that. The President. Q. [Inaudible]—man or a woman? Q.  Inaudible Q. With what type of weapon? Q.  The President. I don't know that, no. The President. Q. Was it a male or a female suspect? Q.  The President. I don't know. You'll have to get that—they'll have a detailed—maybe a briefing for you outside later. The President. Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Did they say anything against you, personally, Mr. President? Q.  The President. I don't know. I didn't ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might have been something else. But it was on the outside of the premises. The wall, the—as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing that they put up, is very powerful. But it was on the outside of the White House. The President. Okay? And they'll have a full report—Secret Service, in a little while, will have a full report. Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Are you rattled by this at all, Mr. President? Q.  The President. I don't know; do I seem rattled? It's unfortunate that this is a world—but the world has always been a dangerous place. It's not something that's unique. The world has been—you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place. And it will continue, I guess, for a period of time. The President. U.S. Secret Service  U.S. Secret Service  Q. Does this make you think differently about your personal safety inside the White House? Q.  The President. No, I feel very safe with the Secret Service. They're fantastic people. They're the best of the best, and they're highly trained. I don't know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific-looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There's nobody like these people. The President. So they just wanted me to step aside for a little while, just to make sure that everything was cleared outside, because it was right in this area. The President's Decision To Return to the Briefing Room  The President's Decision To Return to the Briefing Room  Q. Why did you come back, Mr. President? Why did you decide, after that—because obviously, it created a lot of commotion—what made you decide to come back and continue to the briefing? Q.  The President. Well, I didn't even think about not coming back. I said, ""Am I able to go back?"" And they said, ""You'd have to wait a little while."" I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, ""Can I get back now?"" And they said, ""Yes."" The President. And they have a lot of fortification outside, just in case. But it was one person. Okay? Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. Mr. President, when you said the shooting—you said the shooting was outside. How far away from the White House? Q.  The President. Well, they're going to be giving you a full briefing in a little while. The President. Q. Was it pretty far from the White House? Or was it right in front of that? Q.  The President. I can only tell you, they're going to going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises, near the fence, but outside of the premises. The President. Q. But it was near the fence, so pretty close to here. Q.  The President. Yes, pretty close. The President. So I was telling you that the Dow Jones and the S&P 500—— Q. [Inaudible] Q.  Inaudible The President. ——are now 50 percent above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It's already broken the record, despite the situation of having the China virus. The President.  We have new jobs are rising, and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past 3 months, we've created over 9 million jobs, and that's a record—a 3-month record. If you add it up, it's a 3-month record, by far. And we've beaten expectations by 12 million. We're 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable. Today we had great reports on new job openings. And there's clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing, and an automobile boom. We've rarely seen anything like it, and it's going on right now in America. Inventories are at rock bottom. Used car sales are at record levels. And we will have rebuilt—we're doing a rebuilding like nobody has ever seen. It's a big plus for manufacturing and construction. So construction is getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great. Very happy for Michigan, the State of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can't grow at a 20-percent pace in the third quarter; that would be a record. And interestingly, it will be a number that's going to be announced before November 3. It gets announced probably around November 1, which is very interesting. But it's going to grow at a very substantial pace, based on all of the numbers we're looking at, and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought. We're creating new incentives for work and jobs, and we're also providing much-needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now—while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening, in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we'll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months. And certainly, before the end of the year, I think we'll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially, and we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. And frankly, that's the one I'd rather have faster because you'd go in, you'd give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they'd be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later. If the States participate in our cost-sharing unemployment plan—we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don't have to repeat what they are; you know very well. And we've had some tremendous success already if you look at what's happening with the stock market, and people are very thrilled at what we're doing. We'd like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they're focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running States. We have many great-running States, States that are setting records. And let's see what happens with respect to that. But the—we're looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we're looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle-income families. We're looking at expanding the tax cuts that we've already done, but specifically for middle-income families, and you'll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks, and I think it'll be very exciting. So a capital gains tax is going to be—a lot of people put to work, and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle-income income tax. So I now want to just discuss a little, quick brief, and then we'll take a few more questions, but we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started, right? [Laughter] Is that right, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News]? But that's the way it happens sometimes. Laughter We want to discuss, if we might, the China virus. And the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where—it's very interesting: Because we're so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, we'd have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing. It's a great record to have. In many ways, we've tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now, and nobody is even close to that number. No other country is close. India would be second, at 11 million, and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number-one testing anywhere in the world, by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality test. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality, including the short-term and the lab test. The lab tests take a little bit longer. And Dr. Birx was telling me, a little while ago, that we're down to 2 days and 2½ days on getting your result on the lab test; the other ones, you get them in 5 minutes to 15 minutes. So that's exciting. But countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. In recent days, cases have rapidly increased in Japan and Australia, unfortunately, and they're now experiencing higher peaks than they did in March. To the south of the border—of our border—cases have continued to surge in Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and throughout Latin America. It's really the hotspot. It's posing a major challenge for this continent. Latin America is now the region with the most number of confirmed cases, by far, despite a relative scarcity of testing. So when you think of that, that means it's pretty much on fire. They're having a hard time, and we're helping them. We're sending them tremendous numbers of ventilators, which we're making by the thousands every month. And we're helping Latin America very much. It's hard for them to come into the country because we have big sections of wall up now. The new wall is being built, which people don't talk about. They used to talk about nothing but the wall. Now that it's being built, they're not talking about it so much. But it's helped us, because we're up to almost—we're getting close to 280 miles in the most important areas. So that's helping us a lot, in terms of not having people come into the country who are infected with the coronavirus. This global trend underscores the persistence of the virus, including in nations that apply the strictest and most punishing lockdowns. You have nations that are really tough on the lockdowns, and they're getting hit very hard. That's why my administration is pursuing a science-based approach that protects the most vulnerable, preserves hospital capacity, and focuses on the delivery and development of treatments and, ultimately, the vaccine. I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year, and it will be put in service maybe even as we get it, because we're all set, militarily. We're using our military to distribute the vaccine. And logistically, there's nobody like this group of people. I meet with them a lot, and they're ready to go. As soon as they have it, they'll be going. But more importantly, the therapeutics—as I said, I think therapeutics could be great, initially speaking. I think that would be—if I had my choice. But you're going to have them both. You're going to have them both. You're going to have them both very soon too. At the same time, we urge all Americans to apply commonsense mitigation. You all know what that mitigation is; everybody knows it by heart now. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. That's why we have delivered funding, equipment, and rapid testing to our Nation's nursing homes to protect those at high risk. We're very focused on nursing homes and senior citizens' areas. Anywhere that we have senior citizens, we're very, very focused. We've delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices—those are very quick—and shipped over 700,000 tests to nursing homes. Nursing homes are being protected like never before. The United States faces a unique range of challenges that requires our constant vigilance. America is the largest at-risk population of any developed country, by far: 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of the United Kingdom and other European countries. Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that's an important—we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe and heading for even stronger numbers. But one person is too much, as far as I'm concerned. It should have never been allowed to happen. It should have never been allowed to escape China. Nationwide, we continue to see encouraging signs. In the last 7 days, nationwide cases declined by 14 percent, hospitalizations decreased by 7 percent, fatalities decreased by 9 percent. Arizona and Florida are improving rapidly, with fewer patients coming to emergency rooms, by far, as well as decreasing cases, decreasing fatalities, and expected—and expanded hospital capacity. So we have an expanded hospital capacity—it's pretty dramatic when you look at it, meaning we have more room, should we need it. So a lot of tremendous work has been done. In Texas, likewise, the number of patients going to emergency rooms has dropped from July by more than two thirds. That's a lot. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor Texas very closely—terrific Governor, terrific people working on that whole situation in Texas—especially at its test positivity rate, which rose over 20 percent this weekend. Overall, cases in Texas are coming down and have stabilized in the border counties—that's, again, where you have the wall and you're next to—in some cases, the wall. And, in some cases, you'll have it very shortly; you'll have it all built within a number of months. But those areas were hit very hard, and they're likely cases from Mexico that come in, back and forth, from the border. They come in legally. As doctors have found more effective ways to treat patients, the fatality rate continues to improve. Texas has one-sixth the fatality rate of New York and New Jersey that they had in April. And the—if you look at New York and New Jersey, they worked very, very hard, but very heavy density. And they had a lot of different kinds of difficulty. The fatality rates in Florida and Arizona are between 25 and 33 percent of the peak rates of New York and New Jersey. Again, different climate, a different grouping, a different density—tremendously different density. In California, the situation is starting to stabilize and improve throughout the major metropolitan areas. Statewide, hospitalizations continue to decline very substantially, with about 20-percent fewer in-patients now than on July 21. California is starting to really show signs of correcting. We're monitoring regions with increasing cases, including Boston, Chicago, and the Midwest. And we're monitoring them very, very strongly and very, very hard. I do want to say that I think, at the end of a fairly short period of time, you're going to be in very, very good shape all over our country. Every loss of life is tragic, and all nations must work together to defeat this horrible virus. My administration is going to continue to save as many lives as possible. We are working around the clock—everybody. I mean, it's incredible how hard they're working. And people from other countries—we're working with them also, and they're working very hard. This is something that's now attacked 188 different countries. There are wide range of factors that determine how the virus impacts a nation such as age, underlining [underlying]* conditions. Underlying conditions is a very big one. If you're sick in any way, if you're—if—especially, they say, heart and diabetes. That's not a good thing to have if you're going to have this, if you're going to catch it. So we're trying to protect especially those people that have problems with their heart or diabetes and levels of preexisting immunity resulting from past exposure to other viruses, which happens. We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world. And we're going to figure it out, and we're going to find out, and we're very angry about it. On the therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates are currently in phase three clinical trials—something that would have been impossible under the previous administration or any other administration—and several others are showing considerable promise. We have great companies, very well-known companies. I think everyone in this room would know these companies, but they're the biggest and the best in the world. And we're working with other foreign companies and countries that have—have been really working very closely with us. We're trading—we're not looking to do anything but come up with the answer. And we really don't—we don't care; we want to come up with the answer. If it's one of ours or one of theirs, it's okay. We have to come up with the answer, and we're very close to getting it. Some people think we have it. We may have it. We have the best scientists in the world racing to develop a safe vaccine that will end this pandemic, save millions of lives—and that's millions of lives all over the world—and end the harm inflicted by this virus to our society and to all other nations. Last week, the NIH began a clinical trial of remdesivir paired with another approved antiviral drug—an anti-inflammatory drug. You know that remdesivir has been very successful, and now they're experimenting with others, including antivirals and anti-inflammatories, and they're having some very interesting success. We've secured enough remdesivir to treat over 650,000 patients. On Saturday, I took executive action in a signing to save American jobs and support American workers. I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday, with the understanding that after the election—on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that's done a great job—we will be ending that tax. We'll be terminating that tax. On the other hand, the other group wants to raise taxes, and they may want to leave it where you pay it. But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It's a tremendous saving for people. And we're going to be doing it, and we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time. It's for those making less than $100,000, through end of 2020, to provide an extra $400 per week. Also, in unemployment benefits and to extend the freeze on home evictions—we want to extend the freeze so people aren't evicted. It's not their fault that the virus came from China. It's China's fault. And to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year and then beyond. And again, you know, they're paying interest on loans, and they're not allowed to go to their college. So we're going to suspend payments on student loans, through the end of the year. And then, another extension most likely, because it's not fair to the students to have to pay when the colleges aren't doing the job of getting open. And I think, probably, many of them could be open. So I want to thank you all. I'm sorry for the disturbance before. Things happen. And if you'd like, we could take a few questions. Yes. Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/The President's Team of Advisers  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/The President's Team of Advisers  Q. I have a question. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. Kayleigh said earlier today that you've been working around the clock so there's no delay to get these enhancement unemployment payments to Americans. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. Can you give me your timetable? Are we talking next week, 2 weeks, a month? Q.  The President. Steve, what do you think? Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. Within the next week or two, we think the States will be able to execute. The President. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin. Q. So, Mr. Secretary, you're saying when? Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. I think, within the next week or two, most of the States will be able to execute. Secretary Mnuchin. Q. Got it. And most of the States—— Q.  The President. Wait, by the way, the gentlemen—you know everybody. You know Russell. You know—but this is Scott Atlas. Do you know that? Right? The President. Q. Yes. Q.  The President. Scott is a very famous man—[laughter]—who's also very highly respected—Stanford. And he's working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus. And he has many great ideas. And he thinks what we've done is really good, and now we'll take it to a new level. And so it's great to have Scott working along with us. And we appreciate it very much, Scott. Thank you very much, Scott. Thank you very much. The President. laughter White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Thank you very much. White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. The President. Really terrific. The President. Q. And to follow up—— Q.  The President. We've had some great discussions. The President. Unemployment Insurance Benefits/Cost-Sharing With States  Unemployment Insurance Benefits/Cost-Sharing With States  Q. To follow up on that, Mr. President, if you don't mind. You mentioned the States; have all the Governors signed on to this? Q.  The President. We just had a meeting with the Governors, and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their States. And if they—depending on the State, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25 percent, or we don't have to do that. So we'll see what it is; it depends on the individual State. The President. But a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I've instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can. Right? Secretary Mnuchin. Yes. Secretary Mnuchin. The President. So we'll get it done. The President. Yes, please. Shooting Outside of the White House  Shooting Outside of the White House  Q. I have a question about coronavirus, but I wanted to just ask you to be clear on the incident outside. There's a fairly significant perimeter around the White House. So does it concern you at all that someone who is armed was able to get so close that you needed to be removed from the briefing room? Q.  The President. Well, I don't know if he was close or not—he or she. I don't know if it was a he or a she. But I have such confidence in these people; they're so good. And I don't think the person breached anything. It was on the outside grounds. So I don't believe anything was breached. I asked that question. So they were relatively far away. School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children/National Economy  The President. School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children/National Economy  Q. And on coronavirus: 97,000 children tested positive for coronavirus in the last 2 weeks in July, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Does that give you any pause about schools reopening for—— Q.  The President. No. The President. Q. ——in-person learning? Q.  The President. No, because they may have, as you would call it, ""a case."" It may be a case, but it's also a case where there's a tiny—it's a tiny fraction of death—a tiny fraction—and they get better very quickly. The President. Yes, they have—they may have it for a short period of time, but the—as you know, the seriousness of it, in terms of what it leads to, is extraordinarily small, very, very much less than 1 percent. Q. So do you still believe that—— Q.  The President. Jonathan [Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press], go ahead. The President. Q. ——that children are essentially immune to the virus? Q.  The President. Yes, I think that, for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they don't get very sick. They don't catch it easily. They don't get very sick. And, according to the people that I've spoken to, they don't transport it or transfer it to other people or certainly not very easily. The President. So yes, I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going. We have incredible numbers despite this. If we could get this going—I think it's a very important thing for the economy to get the schools going. Jonathan, go ahead. 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./2020 Presidential Election/Polling Statistics  2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./2020 Presidential Election/Polling Statistics  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, quote, Joe Biden has ""hurt God""; ""he's against God."" The Vice President has said that he's a man of deep Catholic faith, and he has credited it for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So, sir, what did you mean by that, when you said that Joe Biden has ""hurt God"" or is ""against God""? Q.  The President. Well, if you look at the manifesto that that they've come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do, very importantly, with aspects of religion and faith: I don't think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you just—you can't put that into the realm of a religious group of people, I will say that. The President. And I think it's one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which—I'm not a big believer in polls. I wouldn't—if I was, I guess I wouldn't be standing here right now. And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know, and Joe's are going down very rapidly. He'll have to come out of the basement, it looks like, pretty soon, because that—you know, it's one of those things. But no, if you look at the manifesto—I call it the ""manifesto."" A lot of people are calling it a ""manifesto."" My opinion: It's further left than where Bernie was before. So normally, he'd be left, and you'd bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there—and I'm not only talking in terms of religion; I'm not talking, even, in terms of religion—but some of the things they have in the agreement made—and this was an agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe—it's a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country. It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. We will—it will be terrible for health care. Just terrible. You'll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country. Okay. Yes, please, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters]. Health Insurance Reforms/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  Health Insurance Reforms/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  Q. Thank you, sir. I'd like to ask you a question about something you said in Bedminster as well. You said that you're planning to issue an Executive order to ensure that health insurance companies prevent—or cover people with preexisting—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——conditions. And you said that that had ""never been done before."" But that's not the case, because that is the law under the Affordable Care Act. So my question is: Why do you need to issue an Executive order for a law—— Q.  The President. Well, I said no—— The President. Q. ——that is already existing? Q.  The President. Yes. Yes, but, I didn't say—I said, as an Executive order. I—as you said, I said, as an Executive order, it hasn't been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of. The President. As you know, we've done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which really ended Obamacare, as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part—where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your health care. And that was a disaster for people and a very unpopular—that was called the ""individual mandate,"" and we terminated that and—officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for by many, many people. But the individual mandate will always be with us. The individual mandate termination will always be—they can't start it up. In fact, I don't even believe—you'll have to tell me—I don't believe it's been challenged when we ended it. And preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100 percent there. And I'll be issuing, at some point in the not-too-distant future, a very strong statement on that, probably in the form of an Executive order. Q. But why do you need, sir, to do an Executive order if it's already a part of existing law? Q.  The President. Just a double safety net and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally, strongly in favor of preexisting condition—taking care of people with preexisting conditions. The President. It's a signal to people. It's a second platform. We have—preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100 percent by Republicans and the Republican Party. I think it's a very—I actually think it's a very important statement. Yes, please. Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Summit Port Warehouse Explosion in Beirut, Lebanon/Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Summit Q. Mr. President, do you still intend to try to hold an in-person G-7 meeting in the United States at some point in August and September? And have you already sent out invitations to do so? Q.  The President. No, we haven't sent out invitations. We're talking to them. As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I've ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They're having revolution right now in that country. It's just a terrible thing. And—but I was—yesterday, 8 o'clock in the morning, we had a—our time—we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there. The President. I'm much more inclined to do it sometime after the election. We were going to do it in September. They'd like to do it. We could do it through teleconference, or we could do it through a meeting. But I sort of am now suggesting—I told my people yesterday, actually, ""Why don't we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit—you have a little bit more time to think about it,"" because that's very important. Q. Have you decided to invite—— Q.  The President. The G-7 is very important. The President. Q. ——President Putin to that meeting? Q.  The President. I don't know. But we have invited a number of people to the meeting. I certainly would invite him to the meeting; I think he's an important factor. But we will invite certain people that aren't in the G-7. Some people have already accepted. The President. But we're going to be doing it after the election. I think it's a better atmosphere to have a G-7. I think it's a lot—I think it's just a better, calmer atmosphere to have a G-7. Yes, please. Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask Secretary Mnuchin, actually: Have you spoken to any Democrats since Friday? Have they reached out to you at all about restarting negotiations? Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. I've spoken to several Democrats. I have not spoken to Schumer and Pelosi since then. Secretary Mnuchin. Q. Do you expect to—would you reach out at all to them to—[inaudible]? Q.  inaudible Secretary Mnuchin. I said any time they want to meet and they're willing to negotiate and have a new proposal, we're more than happy to meet. Secretary Mnuchin. The President. They're hurting people very badly. This would have been so easy for them to do. And I saw that Senator Schumer said today, on a show—I don't know what show—but he said today on a show that we should meet; we should do something. But you know, where's he been for—how many weeks have you been negotiating, like 4? The President. Secretary Mnuchin. Yes, sir. Secretary Mnuchin. The President. And they should do something; it would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it. But we did something that's very important. And frankly, it's been well received—very well received. The President. Go ahead, please. 2020 Republican Presidential Acceptance Speech Location 2020 Republican Presidential Acceptance Speech Location Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You tweeted earlier today that you're considering Gettysburg as a—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——venue for your speech for the RNC nomination acceptance. What's your thinking behind that as a possible location? Q.  The President. Well, I think it's—I've been to Gettysburg numerous times. It's a national park; it's a national historic site. It's incredible. You know, it's the history. It's incredible, actually, to me. It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country. The President. So we're looking at that, and we're looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for Secret Service. You see what just went on here. They're all here. Just like you have your seats; they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn't be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it, also. Least expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a Government expense and I—you know, look, I watch—also with Government, I watch to make sure that we do what's right. But we're looking at Gettysburg, and we're looking at the White House. And we have other sites too, but I think these would be two really beautiful sites. Jennifer, please. Q. Could we get an update on—— Q.  Q. But if it were here or there, would you envision having an audience for that speech? Q.  The President. You could. You have plenty of room at both locations. The President. I see John Roberts. John, you were outside. You said you heard shots fired before? Shooting Outside the White House  Shooting Outside the White House  Q. I heard two shots in rapid succession just after you took the podium. Q.  The President. And they were shots pretty much? The President. Q. It certainly sounded like gunshots. Q.  The President. And you definitely know the difference, I know that. The President. Q. I'm sorry? Q.  The President. That's—you know the difference. I—you thought they were shots, John? The President. Q. It definitely sounded like gunfire. Q.  The President. I saw your report inside when I went inside. It was a good report too. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. The President. Jennifer, please. China-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Global Coronavirus Pandemic  China-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Global Coronavirus Pandemic  Q. Thank you, sir. Can you give us an update on China? Do you think that your administration will respond to the sanctions that China announced this morning on American officials? The President. Well, we've already responded in many different ways. We're talking a lot about China. We shouldn't have been talking about China. We did a phase one deal, and it was a wonderful deal. And all of a sudden, it means very little in the overall import of things. Q.  The President. They should have never allowed what happened to the world, including us. But this was released into Europe, and it was released into the U.S., and it was released all throughout the world, but it wasn't released into China. And we were doing numbers that will—you know, just were incredible. And we hope to be able to do them, perhaps, even next year. I think we're going have an incredible year next year. But that will never pay for the loss of life in our country and all over the world. So we are—we view China differently than we did 8 months ago. Very much differently. China-U.S. Trade/World Trade Organization/2020 Presidential Election/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia/Germany/Federal Assistance to Farmers  China-U.S. Trade/World Trade Organization/2020 Presidential Election/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Russia/Germany/Federal Assistance to Farmers  Q. Can I ask Secretary Mnuchin a question? Q.  The President. Yes, please. The President. Q. Is there still any consideration of delisting Chinese companies? Is that an ongoing discussion? Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. Delisting? Secretary Mnuchin. Q. Delisting Chinese companies. Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. Well, we never comment on specific things, but no, there's nothing in particular on—— Secretary Mnuchin. Q. Could it still be on the table? Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. There's no—again, nothing specifically at the moment on—are you talking about delisting—— Secretary Mnuchin. Q. For the U.S. stock exchange. Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. Oh, companies on the exchange? Secretary Mnuchin. Q. Yes. Q.  Secretary Mnuchin. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, so just to be clear, we did make the recommendation and the SEC will be putting out—yes, as of the end of next year, if they do not fully comply—and that's Chinese companies, any other companies—they all have to comply with the same exact accounting or they will be delisted on the exchanges. Secretary Mnuchin. I thought you meant sanctions. The President. But also—— The President. Secretary Mnuchin. I was confused when you said ""delisting."" Secretary Mnuchin. The President. And, Jennifer, we're also talking, on the WTO—the World Trade Organization—China is treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that's developing. They're treated as what they call a ""developing nation,"" which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets, and over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation? I don't think so. I don't think, for purposes of what we're talking about, it should be. And we are putting in—and we've already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation and have advantages over the U.S. And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that 2 years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly, and assure—they're not going to have any more advantages over—this should have been done by numerous Presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else, and it's a very unfair situation. The President. No, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be—if you look at what's going to happen, whether it's Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election is over if we win the election. But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country. And they're all waiting to see the election. And if we make a—if we have a win in—on November 3, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within 1 month. And I don't know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I'm saying to myself, ""Gee."" But China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia—it was just reported, the numbers, I raised $400 billion extra in NATO. You know that. It went from $130 [billion]* to $400 billion—and that's a year—in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that. We became the biggest energy exporter. We are now—if you look at what we have, we're energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military. I exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline: Nord Stream 2. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, ""What's this all about?"" So we protect Germany from Russia, and Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for energy, and it's a big portion of Germany's energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they're at a very big disadvantage. So no, Russia would not be happy. And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all. And we've taken in tens of billions of dollars. There's your head of the Treasury—Steve, right? We've taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 10 cents from China, never—not even 10 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted. And we gave $28 billion, compliments of China, to our great farmers and ranchers because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said: ""We're not going to do that. We're going to—instead of making a better deal, we're going to tariff you at very high numbers: 25 percent, 10 percent, and actually numbers that could go up a lot."" And we had a lot of money left over. After giving the $28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars left over, and we're still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we're still receiving that money. So if we win the election, we'll have deals with a lot of countries very fast. They're just waiting to see who wins, because they are hoping—they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what's going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401(k)s will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember, stocks, there's—these big companies, they're owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else. But the 401(k)s, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles. They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can't pay for what they want to do anyway, and what they're going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things. We're going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care; they're going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing. So you will have a crash like you've never seen before. And I've been very good at predicting these things. Yes, please, go ahead. Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election  Potential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election  Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. You just mentioned President Putin and the possibility of inviting him here because he's important. Your own Director of National Intelligence has said that Russia is currently planning—or actually meddling in the election. Have you raised that directly with Putin ever? Q.  The President. Well, they—they said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best, so—— The President. Q. That's according to the DNI, not me. Q.  The President. So what they do—it's all right. Well, I'm just saying, the way the politicians—look, the other day, they said—the three countries—they said China and Russia and Iran. And some reporter got up and said, ""Russia is meddling."" I said: ""Well, didn't it mention China and Iran? Why didn't you mention them too?"" The President. Q. Because you were referring to Putin just now, sir. Q.  The President. So I don't know. You know what I'm telling you? I'll tell you who's meddling in our elections: The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail-in ballots that—where there's corruption all over the place. The President. If you check what happened in New York—a small—relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney. And they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement. So they called her; they declared her the winner. And they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent, is very angry. But they had mail-in voting. And they had hundreds and, I think, even thousands of ballots that are missing, that were fraudulent. Take a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications, and they're going to people that aren't supposed to be getting an application. Yes, please. Go ahead. Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts  Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts  Q. Thank you, sir. Secretary Pompeo is heading to Europe again—— Q.  The President. Right—— Q. ——next week. Do you have any updates on when the travel restrictions to the EU are going to be lifted? It seems strange we're offering exemptions for professional athletes, but not to K-1 visa holders, the so-called, you know, ""fiancé""—— The President. Q.  The President. Well, we're trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events, and that's good for our economy; that's good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions, and they make sure everyone is perfectly tested and everyone comes in at a hundred percent. The President. But you know, we do make certain accommodations, because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That's economic development, et cetera. But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what's the best timing. Don't forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really—they lead the way. They led it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And—in terms of, they got hit earlier than we did. Quite a bit earlier than we did. So I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do, in retrospect. We're getting—I mean, that's—that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn't want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in, and then we put a ban on Europe coming in. But we're working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off. Yes, please. Coronavirus Mortality Rates/Federal Coronavirus Response  Coronavirus Mortality Rates/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. [Inaudible]—if 160,000 people had died on President Obama's watch, do you think you would have called for his resignation? Q.  Inaudible The President. No, I wouldn't have done that. I think it's been amazing what we've been able to do. If we didn't close up our country, we would have had 1½ or 2 million people already dead. We've called it right; now we don't have to close it. We understand the disease. The President. Nobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is, in 1917, they say, right? The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious. No, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now, all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open, and you could be up to a million and a half or 2 million people right now—1½ to 2 million people. Our people have done a fantastic job, our consultants and our doctors. You know, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we've done with ventilators has been amazing. What we've done with medical equipment has been incredible. We've supplied the Governors. Nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn't get it. And you know, at the beginning, there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have. So we would have lost—if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people. Multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable. But that's what would have happened had we kept it open. So no, I think we're a very large country. We are—one person—and I say it all the time; a lot of people like to leave that out—one person is too many. It should have never happened. But they've done a—really, an extraordinary job. They'll never be given the credit—and I'm not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they've done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country. Really, an extraordinary job. And a lot of the Governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their States, and they go up, and I think I can tell you that a lot of the Governors have done an extraordinary job too. Yes, please go ahead. Brazil-U.S. Relations/The President's Use of Tariffs  Brazil-U.S. Relations/The President's Use of Tariffs  Q. Mr. President, thank you. Did you ask the U.S. Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts in eliminating ethanol tariffs in Brazil? Q.  The President. You have to—you can't—yes. The President. Q. Did you ask the Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts to lower, to eliminate ethanol tariffs in Brazil? Q.  The President. We haven't really discussed that too much, but at some point, we probably will be. And we don't want people tariffing us. And if they tariff us—although, I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He's great. He's—and I hear he's doing well. He's recovered from having COVID. ""Having COVID-19,"" as they say. And that's great. And send him my regards. The President. Q. [Inaudible] Q. Inaudible The President. I think that, as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness in tariffs, because we have many countries, for many years, that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don't charge them. And it's called ""reciprocity."" It's called ""reciprocal tariffs."" And you may be seeing something on that very soon. The President.  Did you have one, OAN? Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Q. [Inaudible]—Brazil on coronavirus, Mr. President. Q.  Inaudible The President. OAN, please. The President. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, thank you for coming back to finish the briefing—— Q.  The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. The President. Q. ——after the scuffle. So I have an opinion question for you. Q.  The President. Okay. The President. Q. Joe Biden is set to announce his running mate. At any time now, we expect him to announce her. Q.  Many of your supporters feel that the reason that Obama's former NSA, Susan Rice, is at the top of Biden's list is that she can best cover up a lot of the Obamagate surveillance crimes that have taken place during your campaign. What are your thoughts? What is your opinion? Do you subscribe to that line of thought? And how do you feel about it? The President. Well, look, the Obama campaign spied on our campaign. And they've been caught, all right? And now let's see what happens to them. But they have been caught. They've been caught red-handed. It's probably treason. It's a horrible thing they did. It probably never happened before; at least, nobody got caught doing it. The President. But they used the intelligence agencies of our country to spy on my campaign, and they have been caught. And there are a lot of people involved. I don't want to say how much she's involved. Frankly, if he chooses her, that's fine. But that's a potential liability. We'll see. But President Obama knew about it. Joe Biden knew about it. Comey—[laughter]—knew about it. Brennan, Clapper, the whole group, they all knew about it. Lisa Page and her lover Strzok, they all knew about it. laughter And we have it documented. We have it in texts. We have it in all sorts of forms. They knew about it. It was a terrible thing. It should have never happened and should never be allowed to happen again to a President. This should never happen again. This was a setup like we've never seen. I think it's the political crime of the century, and they've been caught. So let's see what happens to them all. Thank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1252"
"18","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 11, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Nice to be with you all. Good evening. The President. Before providing today's update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle. The mayors and Governors of these States and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death. New York City has an army of great police. I know them very well. And the law enforcement and the New York's Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job. If they do their job, if they're allowed to do their job, the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly. They do it well. The mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification. They were fired. I guess that's part of ""Defund the Police"" by the Democrats. They should hire New York City's Finest back. You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things. Together, the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and guardsmen available to quell any violence. They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs—again, if allowed to do their jobs. Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs. The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats—or both, because they're becoming one and the same, if you look at election results—the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. The city of Portland and the State of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and guardsmen available. Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available. So Seattle—city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people. They have to be allowed to do their job. I'm urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on—although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don't like to put it on, because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement. They have to put it on. They have to be honest with the people of this country. But I'm offering all available Federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals. We have to be asked by the Governors or the mayors, and we'll be there very rapidly. It's ready, willing, and able. We're all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them. We'll do them very quickly. You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart. When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately. It was immediate and lasted. These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, left-wing extremism that you get to see if you're watching the right news program. Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of left-wing domestic terrorism. They really are anarchists. These are left-wing anarchists. They are anarchists. And I'm directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists—immediately, to stop them—and to work with the city and the State to get the job done. Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately. We'll work with you. And the local authorities know who they are. They know where they come from. They know a lot about them. They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we're ready to help. If you need that help—you shouldn't need that help, actually. You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well. Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job. What you're seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America. They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form. They want to pass Federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. They want to end cash bail, close prisons, defund police departments or at least largely defund. You see that with New York. A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof. And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens. If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe. On the vaccine front, some very good news. Today I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We heard an update from the top scientists in the Government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren't too thrilled with me. They're taking millions of dollars' worth of ads because I've created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases, numbers that have never been heard or thought of. So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down. When you see ads attacking your President, it's very simple—that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon. This evening I'm pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The Federal Government will own these vaccine doses; we're buying them. Recently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson and Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK],* to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines. Doing very well on those vaccines—tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them. And they're years ahead of schedule. This would have been—if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already, the final stage of clinical trials. This is the final stage. We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery. The military is ready to go. They're ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we're moving very close to that approval. We're on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter. So we'll have 600 million doses. Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. We've treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible. We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent and possibly even more than 50 percent. I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate. We would really appreciate that, because it's been very successful—unbelievably successful—and we would love you to go and donate. As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible. You've seen the numbers. You see what's going on yesterday, today—and tomorrow, in my opinion. We're very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else. Today the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50-percent surge since just March. So we've increased by 50-percent more than since just March. It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period—March—and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our Nation—think of that. America's economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations. Last quarter, the European Union's GDP decline was nearly 40-percent worse than the United States. So it's 40-percent worse than the United States. We've built such a strong base that we're able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far. France's GDP decline was nearly 80-percent worse than ours. And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States. Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic, very substantial improvements. Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases. Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases. Mortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly. States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent. But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible. Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask. And protect the elderly—always protect the elderly. Since the end of July, the 7-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe. Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in 3 months; not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media. The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately; and that is truly unfortunate. It's increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom. Those are big increases. Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries. And in our country, they're going down. We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by—a short time. Even though America is the largest at-risk population—including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries—Europe has experienced a nearly 40-percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States. We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-State area—which had a very, very hard time—and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill, something that the news doesn't tell you. They don't tell you that. They don't like to tell you that. The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world. India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million. So we're at 66 million. And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests. Yet Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States. As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools—and hopefully, we can watch colleges play football. We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won't have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start, and hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there. They're going to be out there, playing football, and they'll be able to fight it off. And hopefully, it won't bother them one bit. Most of them will never get it, statistically. But we know we'll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we're doing. So college football, get out there and play football. People want to see it. And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem, because people are not happy when that doesn't happen. You look at the NBA and what's happening with the NBA and their poor ratings. I don't know; can't imagine why. But they didn't stand, they didn't show respect to our flag. They didn't show respect to our national anthem. And maybe that's having an impact, but you—just not good. The NFL had its problems, 2 years ago, when that happened. They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back. And now, all of a sudden, they're putting themselves in the same position. So stand for your flag, and stand for the national anthem, and I think you're going to do fantastically well. Because a lot of people aren't going to watch if you don't; I'm one of them. That's why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death. We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population. We've learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott. We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness, diabetes, in particular. And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding. We're in great shape. On the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy. HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus. We have delivered over 1,800 rapid, point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes. And we are in the process of delivering these devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September. So they're going to have very, very rapid tests. They won't have to wait around 2 or 3 days or 4 days. And that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was. When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back. But we are now at a position where we're sending very, very rapid tests—5 minutes to 15 minutes. We will care for America's seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics. And therapeutics are coming along very, very well. We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you'll be hearing that—about them in the very near future. I'm very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion. There's combinations of what you can do, and people get better. I like that very much. I like that very, very much. And that could even precede—and it's successful in getting it—that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines. But therapeutically, we're doing very, very well. A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we're—that I'm seeing, and some of the results. So tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself. We're going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out. Okay. Questions, please. Please, go ahead. Moratorium on Evictions  Moratorium on Evictions  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Twenty million people are due to be evicted from their homes next month. Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. And are you—do you fear that this could be your Herbert Hoover moment if you do not reach a deal with Congress to set up a new CARES Act? Q.  The President. No, we are not allowing that to happen. We're stopping evictions. We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen. The President. Q. And also—— Q.  The President. We're not going to evict people. We're not going to let people—the Democrats, maybe they don't care, but I care. And we signed an Executive offer—you know, Executive order. You know that, right? And we are not letting people be evicted. The President. Q. There was a suggestion—— Q.  The President. Please. The President. Senator Kamala D. Harris/Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Senator Kamala D. Harris/Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Q. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. If I could have two questions, I'd like to ask you one about Senator Harris's record and then a different one about FISA abuse. Q.  The President. Sure. The President. Q. So, regarding Senator Harris's record: You had a pretty quick response to that. You had an ad out that said that she was a ""phony."" And I wanted to drill down— Q.  The President. That she was a what? The President. Q. A phony. A phony. Q.  The President. Oh. The President. Q. And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment. As San Francisco DA, she oversaw, according to the Mercury News, 1,900 marijuana convictions. But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana, and she appeared to joke and, according to some people, lie, and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg and Tupac, while—their music hadn't come out at the time, while she said she was smoking pot and listening to it. Why would she lie about that? Do you see that as more evidence? Is her past on marijuana a liability? Q.  The President. Well, she lied. I mean, she said things that were untrue. She is a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true. She's very big into raising taxes. She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody has—can even believe. She is against fracking. Fracking is—she's against petroleum products. I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great State of Texas? She is against fracking; fracking is a big deal. The President. She is in favor of socialized medicine, where you're going to lose your doctors, you're going to lose your plans. She wants to take your health care plans away from 180 million Americans, 180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance. And she wants to take that away. So she was my number-one pick. I mean, she was—as they would say, because, hopefully, you'll start college football—she was my number-one draft pick. And we'll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries, as you know. She was expected to do well, and she was—she ended up at right around 2 percent and spent a lot of money. She had a lot of things happening. And so I was a little surprised that he picked her. I've been watching her for a long time, and I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Kavanaugh—Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing. The way she was—the way she treated now-Justice Kavanaugh. And I won't forget that soon. So she did very poorly in the primaries, and now she's chosen. So let's see how that all works out. Q. Should supporters of marijuana legalization vote for you, rather than her, because she convicted so many people in the past? Q.  The President. I can't tell you what she's voting for. I don't think she knows what; I think Joe knows even less than she does. But I was only surprised at the pick. A lot of people were saying, ""That might be the pick."" I was more surprised than anything else, because she did so poorly. Many people did much better than her in the primary. She did very poorly in the primaries. And that's like a poll. [Laughter] You know, that's like a poll. The President. Laughter Please. Q. Can I also ask you about FISA abuse, President Trump? Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. Yes, about FISA abuse: So now it's widely accepted among Republicans that there was FISA abuse in—— Q.  The President. Tremendous FISA abuse, yes. The President. Q. The Justice Department IG has found out, with the Carter Page foreign application. But we were actually warned in 2013 that the Surveillance Court was, allegedly, a rubber stamp. It was approving surveillance. Q.  And I was wondering: I don't think, as President, you've commented on Edward Snowden, but do you think he should be allowed to return without going to prison? The President. So as far FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It's amazing that it's taken this long. And everyone knows that it's been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse, changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA Court and courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it. The President. And the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan and Comey and Clapper, the whole group. We caught them spying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason. And Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies of the United States Government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election and then after I won, they continued. It's totally illegal activity, and now we just have to see what's happening. But as far as Kamala is concerned, she's a big tax raiser, she's a big slasher of funds for our military, and she's got a lot of difficult things that she's going to have to explain. Plus, she was very, very nasty to—one of the reasons it surprised me, she was very—she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates—during the Democrat primary debates—that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn't have picked. OAN, please. Please. Thank you very much. Seattle, Washington  Seattle, Washington  Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday Seattle City Council voted to cut funding for their police department, and the chief—the police chief there, Carmen Best, the first Black woman to serve in that capacity—she resigned hours later. What does this say about our country? And what does this say about the ""defund police"" movement? Q.  The President. Well, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they've been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group—Antifa and others—take over a big portion of the city of Seattle—we're talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn't want that to happen. They don't want to be embarrassed. And the people just gave up. They weren't—they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long. The President. The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department, really, where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job. So I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are. They've done a big—a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they're doing. They have no clue. And hopefully, there'll be asking for help, because we can solve their problem very, very quickly. Yes, go ahead. Q. Thank you, sir. Q. Vice President Michael R. Pence/Senator Kamala D. Harris  Vice President Michael R. Pence/Senator Kamala D. Harris  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two quick questions. One on Senator Harris: Very simply, is she going to help former Vice President Biden's chances in November? Or is she going to hurt his chances? The President. Well, I like Vice President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock. He's been a fantastic Vice President. He's done everything you can do. He's respected by every religious group. Whether it's evangelical, whether it's any other group, they respect Mike Pence. Q.  The President. He's been a great Vice President, and I will take him over Kamala and the horrible way she, again, treated Justice Kavanaugh. That was a horrible event. I thought it was terrible for her. I thought it was terrible for our Nation. I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate. She's also known, from what I understand, as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would have thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit. Because with what they're doing with open borders and sanctuary cities—where they're trying to protect sanctuary cities, which is also protecting a large number of criminals—with all of the things that they're doing—Second Amendment. They want to take away your Second Amendment or modify it to a point where it's essentially no longer the Second Amendment. I would have thought he would have gone a different way. Thank you very much, everybody. Q. A follow-up, Mr. President—— Q.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1253"
"19","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 12, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here, and good evening. As we continue to confront the China virus, we're rebuilding America's economy like nobody thought possible, actually. We're doing incredibly well. The President. The stock market is up almost 300 points again today. While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe—which people have to understand—very strongly; it's performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually. At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States. And I will say that that's a significant number. We're working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way. We're doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics. But think of that: We have the strongest economy—performing economy in the world. We're up—I think it's $9 trillion since March—$9 trillion in value. That's a number that nobody has ever heard of before. We're also getting close to about a 50-percent number since March, which is incredible. So it's $9 trillion. It's almost 50 percent. In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300-point increase. And it's—so we're doing much better than Europe, significantly. And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States. I just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently. We'll be, probably, over 300 judges—Federal judges, including Court of Appeals judges—approved by the end of my first term. And other than they—when they added new judges into somebody's term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any—this is a record. Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term. So we're going to have over 300 Federal judges, and that's Court of Appeals judges, and that's just in the first term. It's—probably, we'll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing. The stock market's rebound signals a ""V""-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world—stronger. [At this point, the President indicated the chart displayed on a screen.] At this point, the President indicated the chart displayed on a screen. If you look, you'll see exactly what we have. We lead the world. Japan is second. But in terms of dollar value, it's not even close. So there it is. A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong. The United States is leading the world, very substantially. On the second slide, you'll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations. And you see that, right there; there's the United States. And that's despite the fact that we've done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we've done more, by far, ventilators. We're building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we're distributing them all over the world. We're helping other countries. But despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal. I'm sure you'd love to put them in your various media outlets. I know you want to get that out. If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine. The rapid recovery—but it would be nice to report it. The rapid recovery of homebuilders' sentiment points to massive new construction. And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that's because people have tremendous confidence. This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded. We were at a record, and now we're going to be at a record again very shortly. Those numbers are incredible. That's where we are. And we had to turn off the economy, and now we're turning it back on, and that's beyond a ""V"" shape. This is going to be very strong; it's called a ""strong 'V.'"" Automobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last 3 months—65 percent, automobile demand. And we're anticipating that that's going to go up even further, but that's more than any—anybody else. The manufacturing sector—remember, ""manufacturing is dead,"" according to the past administration of Obama and Biden. ""Manufacturing is dead. You'd need a magic wand."" Well, you don't need a magic wand. You need competence and capability. The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of '18, which is—was a—an extraordinary period of time. [The President indicated another chart on a screen.] The President indicated another chart on a screen. And there we are. That's pretty good. These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they're just coming out. These are numbers that are leading—I guess, the stock market people, they're very smart people. I know many of them, and they're seeing things that they don't even believe. So the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time. The economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last 3 years—a record, by far—and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted. So there you are. You look at that, and that's a record, and it's a record for the quarter. We had over 9 million, substantially more than 9 million jobs. So those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it's coming back. It's coming back very strongly, and it's coming back at a level that's far greater than anybody anticipated. And we're very proud of that. And I give a lot of credit to all of our people—Steve and Larry. And we'll be talking about it. If you have any questions on it—shouldn't have any questions. I didn't print those charts. Who did? The economy generated—let's see. I don't know. We'll find that out for you, but it wasn't us. We took those—we took those numbers from somebody. Where did you get those numbers, Larry? They're from where? National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. It's from the BLS jobs report—— National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. The President. BLS jobs report. The President. Director Kudlow. The monthly jobs report, through July. Director Kudlow. The President. Okay. Everybody has that—everybody who needs? The President. The Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn't want and won't accept. For example, they've asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion—that's billion—$3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption. You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race. They should do that race over, by the way. I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race. When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds—nobody knows what's going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner. So her opponent—I don't know what's happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy. And then, you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened. And they admitted they made a mistake. And many were sent to dead people, and many were sent to—a number was sent—I guess, two—that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs. One was sent to a cat. [Laughter] They're sent all over the place. That was in Virginia. Laughter In Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud. And it's been a disaster. Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster; that's universal mail-in voting. So they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters. They can't do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide. Mail-in voting—it's going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections. When you always talk about ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" China, Iran on voting—your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran. Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats. But now the Democrats—they want $3.5 billion, think of it. But now that they're unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money—of course, we would never approve an amount like that. And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve. Twenty-five billion for the Post Office so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place. They have no idea where they're going. So they want $25 billion, and they want—think of this: They want $3.5 billion. Would you say that's enough to cover it? I think we could do it for less, right? I think we could do it for less. But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this. And remember, the new man—who is a great person, a great businessman—he just got there a little while ago. The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades. Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they've had very bad leadership for many years. So we'll get it straightened out. But they turned down this bill, because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve. So they want $25 billion for the Post Office. They want $2.5 or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in—$3.5 billion. And the bill is not going to happen because they don't even want to talk about it, because we can't give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they're asking for. So therefore, they don't have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can't do it, I guess. Right? Are they going to do it even though they don't have the money? They're asking for the $3.5 billion. They're asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things. At $25 [billion],* I would hope it would be a lot of other things too. But therefore, they don't have it. They don't have the money to do the universal mail-in votes. It will be the greatest rigged election in history. It will be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign: President Obama, Biden, and everybody else. And they got caught. Let's see what happens. This will be one of the greatest frauds in history. So they're admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they're not going to do a deal that's good for the American people. Therefore, they're not going to get the $3.5 billion. Therefore, they can't do the universal mail-in vote. It's very simple. How are they going to do it if they don't have the money to do it? The Democrats are also holding up money for schools and hospitals and small businesses and State and local governments. They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action. And I did Executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they're going forward. I signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided. Remember that: That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided. Nancy and Chuck haven't provided anything. And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem—a pretty big problem, a very big problem—you know what he gave? Twenty-five dollars. He gave 25 bucks. So now they say, ""Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600."" They don't want to give. They don't even give anything. They're not doing anything. But President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe—gave $25. Twenty-five. And they'll complain, ""Oh, we want to give more."" Well, we're giving $400, and that's now in the works, and that will be getting out to the people soon, Steve. Okay? Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time. Twenty-five. I want to make it unmistakably clear that I'm protecting people from evictions. They didn't want to do that. The Democrats didn't want to do a protection from evictions—people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the ""China virus,"" whatever you want to call it. We have 20—now we're up to 21 different names. All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn't have. They should have stopped it. Under my Executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes. They're not going to be evicted. They are not going to be evicted. And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you'll make sure of that. I'm providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020. That's a tremendous amount of money that's being supplied and given to families. Tremendous. The Democrats didn't want to do a payroll tax. They thought it was ""too much money,"" I guess, or it would make businesses too successful. They don't want to see success. They certainly don't want to see it before the election. They certainly don't want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there. They don't. Because they say they can't win. With that kind of success, they can't win. They have to get used to it. Remember: We've already gotten $3 trillion in stimulus, so they should have probably negotiated a little bit differently. Maybe they should have asked for all of this before they got most of the money and we gave it out, a lot of it to the people. When we win the election—when I win the election, I'm going to completely and totally forgive all deferred payroll taxes without in any way, shape, or form hurting Social Security. That money is going to come from the general fund. We're not going to touch Social Security. I said from day one that we were going to protect Social Security, and we're going to protect our people. And Social Security is one of the things that will be protected. Preexisting conditions will be protected. Medicare will be protected. But Social Security will be totally protected under me. Under them, it will not be protected, because we will have a stock market crash the likes of which you've never seen. Your taxes will be doubled and tripled. And your regulations will go through the roof, which is what was causing the problems with the country in the first place. Student loans: I signed a directive providing relief to student borrowers. Not their fault that they can't go to college. I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice. So we're going to take care of our students. We've got a lot of great students out there, and they got hit like everybody else. So I will be deferring payments on student loans at zero interest until further notice. And on the payroll tax, we'll be terminating the payroll tax after I, hopefully, get elected. We'll be terminating the payroll tax, so that will mean anywhere from $5,000 to even more per family, and also great for businesses and great for jobs. A lot of people will be very happy to hear that. A lot of the great—certainly, conservative economists will be great to have—they think that's the greatest thing we can do. That's better than the payments; that's better than anything else. But it's a lot of money, and it's going right directly to the people, and it goes there very easily. But it also creates stronger companies to employ the people. So we will be—on the assumption I win, we are going to be terminating the payroll tax after the beginning of the new year. Today I met with parents, students, teachers, and health experts to discuss the vital importance of safety and safely reopening America's schools. This evening I'll outline the commonsense recommendations that should guide schools as they reopen with precautions. We want to be very, very safe and very careful—so precautions in place. Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide as we race toward the competition—and the completion—we're competing with others, but I'm not completing—competing with anyone. We just want to have a vaccine. We have—we're dealing with other countries, and we want them to do well. We're giving them whatever information they need. We're all working towards something that will happen. It will happen before the end of the year, maybe substantially before, but before the end of the year. And therapeutics will happen, likewise, even sooner. But we're looking for that responsible path forward to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to resume work and school and play football. Go play football. I spoke to some of the great football players—college players—Trevor and a lot of great players called, coach called, Coach O. A lot of fantastic people I got to speak to—athletes, leaders. They want to play football. Let them play. Let them play. And they'll—they feel safer in the field than they do walking around and doing nothing. So, hopefully, that will happen. And hopefully, when they play football, they will proudly stand for the national anthem, and they will proudly stand and respect the American flag—or at least I'm not watching. I can't speak for others, but based on what I see now and based on what I'm looking at, with respect to the NBA at this point, a lot of people agree with me. So we want people—we would like to request people—you stand proudly for the flag and for the national anthem. In the months since the virus arrived, we've learned a great deal. While this is a dangerous and highly infectious disease, it primarily affects the oldest segment of our population or those with chronic health issues. The United States has the largest nursing home and assisted-living home population in the Western world, by far. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. The median age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. These findings underscore that all Americans must continue to apply extreme vigilance in protecting our elderly population and those with chronic conditions. Outcomes are very different for younger Americans without serious health issues—tremendously different. They can often expect mild or moderate symptoms or even no symptoms whatsoever. They have very strong immune systems, we've learned, even more so than we ever thought. In a typical year, approximately five times as many Americans under the age of 65 die from heart disease as have so far been lost to the coronavirus from the same age group. That's an interesting statistic. Blessedly, children appear to face the lowest risk of all. It's 99.995 percent of all fatalities are adults. Think of that: 99.95. That is extremely close to 100 percent of all fatalities are adults. Children often have only mild symptoms, and medical complications are incredibly rare—very, very, very rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. In each of the last 5 years, the flu resulted in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to coronavirus, by far. The flu does kill young people. Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and protect students. All families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstances. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at a high risk. And one of the things we'd like to do is when we make payment to schools—because we spend a lot of money on schools—we'd like to make the payment directly to the student or to the child. And that would be to the parents, essentially, but to the child. We want to follow the child so that if a school is closed, the family can go to another school, maybe in another area, but they can do it. And we'd like to make that payment—rather than paying a school that's closed, we'd rather pay directly. We're following the child—where the child goes. And we want to pay the family, pay the child, and then the family can take care of the cost. And we're trying to get that approved too, but the Democrats don't like doing anything, unless it means doing for the union, which controls Nancy and controls Chuck 100 percent. And I have nothing wrong with the union. I have great respect, more than—very few people do I respect more than a great teacher. That's a tremendous talent. They're really underappreciated. These are phenomenal people with tremendous talent; the great ones are among the most important people we have in this country. But—and they'll be great at other—they'll be great at charter schools. And they'll be great at—well, we talk about school choice, which we'd like to see so that parents can take their children to the school of their choice. That's something we want. We think it's very important, especially in the minority communities. They want it so badly. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American—they want it so badly. But the two people I mentioned, Nancy and Chuck, they're totally controlled by the heads of the union. I think the teachers like us a lot. We're taking care of our teachers. We want to take care of our teachers. But we cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional, and academic development, and inflicting long-term, lasting damage. I heard a gentleman today, a great person—some of you were at that meeting—from Harvard, say that every year is $10,000. It's a—people—they lose a tremendous amount of money in the future. He mentioned $10,000. And I think he was talking about on a yearly basis. They lose a lot by every year of education that they lost. Every year they gain, they gain $10,000. And when you have students sitting at home, playing with a computer, it's not the same. That's one thing we've learned for sure: It's not the same. It can never be the same as being in a classroom. So we want to get our students in the classroom. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommendation that schools reopen. They said, ""Reopen."" It said, quote, ""Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits."" The doctors, also warned about the risk of increased abuse, substance use, depression, and suicide. Suicide. The National Education Association recently stated, ""Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support."" So when you sit at home in a basement, looking at a computer, your brain starts to wither away. We have a lot of good experience at that, just by taking a look at what's happening in politics. Studies estimate that school closures last spring caused the average student to fall 50-percent behind in math and roughly 35 percent in reading compared to a typical year. Think of that: It caused the average student to fall 50-percent behind in math and 35 percent in reading, compared to being at the school, being with your teachers, being in a classroom. We've learned that. We've learned that learning from a laptop is not great. And frankly, we've also learned that telehealth—a little unrelated, but it's up 35,000 percent, and it's been incredible—35,000 percent. We'll check that number, Larry, but that's an incredible—but it is. People staying home, and the telehealth—that has been a tremendous success. We've learned those two things during this period of time with the plague coming in. And those are two things we know. School closures harm low-income students the most because they have less access to high-quality remote learning—they don't have computers—and less resources for academic support. All schools should be making plans to resume in-person classes as soon as possible. To support the reopening of America's schools, we provided $13 billion in elementary and secondary schools toward the CARES Act and CARES Act funding—we're giving CARES Act funding—the vast majority of which remain available for States to use. So a tremendous amount of money: $13 billion. That's the CARES Act funding, and we're giving a large portion of that for States to use. Today I'm pleased to announce that we will provide up to 125 million reusable masks to various school districts all around the country. My administration also stands ready to deploy CDC teams to support schools that are opening and schools that need help in safety and in order to safely reopen. Finally, today my administration is highlighting general recommendations for all schools and guidance to protect high-risk teachers and students. We're working very, very closely with many of the schools and school districts throughout the country. And they include the following: to ensure all students, teachers, and staff understand the symptoms of the China virus; require all students, teachers, and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school; encourage frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing during the school day, beginning upon entrance to school, and ensuring that hand-washing facilities are widely available throughout the school. And, for the most part, schools have been very good at that. Minimize large indoor gatherings. Hold large gatherings outdoors whenever possible; maintain high standards of hygiene and ventilation within the classrooms, including keeping windows and doors open whenever possible, and running fans and air conditioning units whenever possible; require students, teachers, and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals and socially distance whenever possible in any event; encourage the use of masks when social distancing is not possible; post instructions regarding hygiene and social distancing all over the school and all around the school. We encourage schools to adopt these measures. We've been working with so many of them. And, to the best of my knowledge, virtually every one of them agrees to do that. While we're also providing high-risk teachers and students options to engage in distance teaching or learning, we're working on that also. College-age students also continue to be one of the lowest risk demographics. More than 99.8 percent of the deaths from this horrible disease—""the invisible enemy,"" we call it—occur in people over 24 years of age. Think of that: 99.8 percent occur in people over 24 years of age. For this reason, it could be safer for them to live at a school rather than live with their older parents or grandparents. They've got to go to school. We've got to open up. We've got to open up our schools and open up our businesses. And a lot of it has been open, but we can do better. As we move forward, the number of cases is not, by any means, the most important metric to focus on because the fact is, we have more cases because we have far more testing than any country in the world. There's no country that's even close. We've done more testing and better testing than any country. And many of these countries that the media was putting up as a shining example of success, they're, right now, in massive outbreaks. You see what's going on in many of the countries that you constantly mention. Far more important is who the virus is infecting. That's why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require hospitalization or result in death—those that afflict the elderly and those with certain underlying health conditions, all the while acting to prevent hospital overcrowding. If you look at some of the States that had a flare-up recently, they're all doing very well. Florida is going down rapidly. I want to give a lot of credit to the Governors. Florida is going down, and Arizona is going down, way down. They've done a fantastic job. California, as you know, is going down. And many other locations—it's doing very well. And many locations are really in fantastic shape—some with very little, if any, problem—large portions of the United States. Those advocating for a never-ending, blanket, nationwide lockdown have no answer for what it would do to the mental, physical, and social health of millions of American children and people. This includes parents, where they have to stay home with their children because—and they lose their work, and they lose their job because their children isn't at school. They have to have somebody to take care of it, and they want to take care of their child. They don't trust people. A society must put the health and safety of our children first. A man who has the respect of everybody—he's highly respected by me and anybody on this subject; he's the expert—Dr. Scott Atlas is here from Stanford, and he's been working with us for a period of time. And I thought it would be great—he was saying things to me the other day. I said it would be great if you could tell that to the media. So this is the first time I've shared the platform. And it's an honor to do so. Scott is truly—he's a brilliant man. He's a wonderful man. And he cares about the subject very much. And I'd like to ask Scott to come up please and say a few words. Thank you, Scott. White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Thank you, Mr. President. It's obviously a great honor to be here and a great honor to serve this President, who's really focused on the very important parts of the pandemic. White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. And I'm new here. I'm just, sort of, getting involved, but I want to thank you and the Vice President and the entire team, the Task Force team, and all the people who are not very visible, really, for working so hard. These people are working 24/7, and it's quite amazing. And I think the—today we had a fantastic event, that I'll just mention, on opening the schools, because the President's priority is to open the schools and open them safely and have parents have the options to either use open schools or do whatever they can to eventually get back to open schools, including any kind of hybrid or other arrangement they may want to do. It was a great event. We had a group of fantastic parents, teachers, medical experts, and it went very well. And so I won't spend a lot of time up here, but thank you very much, and I hope I can help out in some way. Thank you. The President. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters]. Thank you. The President. ,  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Payroll Tax Cut  Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Payroll Tax Cut  Q. You mentioned the Executive orders that you signed. Are we now unlikely to see any more stimulus legislation before the election? Q.  The President. Well, we're giving $400. And we are in constant touch with Governors, also, who—they'll be making, perhaps, a contribution. They have options. They can do it, or they don't have to do it. I think most of them will do it. The President. We're also doing a payroll tax cut, which is a massive number. That's a very big number. And that's a number that's bigger than the—any of the numbers we talked about. And the beauty of that is that it really incentivizes companies, and—because it's both a company cut and a employee cut. So that much, really—very much incentivizes people to go back to work and work hard and the company to hire people back. And we've had some of the great economic minds saying that's the most important cut; that would be the best cut you could do. We couldn't get the Democrats to even think about agreeing to it. It's not the Democrat way, I guess. Because it just seems that, whether it's Larry Kudlow, or any of your many friends, that's the one they wanted the most. Would you say, Larry? Director Kudlow. Yes, sir. Director Kudlow. The President. And so we're doing that. And that was never even really discussed, because that was taken off the table by the Democrats immediately. The President. And this is every week. Every week, you get a check—or a month, or biweekly. This is a major amount of money that you're getting directly. So it's really—you know, it's a very big number. It's very substantial number. And this is—don't forget, this is in addition to the $400. And this is a big number. And now, at the end of the year, on the assumption that I win, I'm going to terminate the payroll tax, which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done. We'll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely. If Biden would win, he wouldn't do that, because he's going to double and triple everybody's taxes. He's going to have to explain that one. And as you know, he's also going to quadruple regulations. He wants to put regulations on. One of the reasons that we had the kind of numbers and big bounces that you've seen—I mean we closed it up. We saved millions of lives, and now we opened it, and we bounce right back where we were. It looks like we'll be bouncing right back where we were. But one of the reasons is because we cut so many horrible regulations. And Biden, with his new partner, Kamala, will—if you think—he's going to put it all back, but many times more. I mean, they want to increase regulations, and that's just going to drive companies out, and it's going to drive people out. It's going to drive them to other countries, and it's going to make us not competitive with other countries. Please, OAN. Antifa Movement/Civil Unrest and Violence in U.S. Cities  Antifa Movement/Civil Unrest and Violence in U.S. Cities  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to highlight a kind of odd situation. In the last hour or so, if you Googled ""antifa.com,"" it would take you straight to Joe Biden's website, his official campaign website. Odd situation. We don't know who's behind that. Q.  But it raises an interesting leadership question: Should Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Kamala Harris—should they publicly denounce the Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization? The President. They should. I think they're afraid to. It's—in my book, it's virtually a part of their campaign: Antifa. The Democrats act like, ""Gee, I don't know exactly what that is."" Take a look at Portland. Take a look at any place you want to take a look at, and they're all over the place. They were here. We put on a 10-year prison sentence if you knocked down any statues, 2 months ago. And since then, we haven't seen much of them. The President. We had to send border security—and we sent actually Homeland and Border and different forms of Homeland to Portland, in order to—you know what we had to do. We had to save—they wanted to knock down a courthouse—a $500 million courthouse—they wanted to burn it down, knock it down. And they were easily able to defend. But the mayor and the Governor of the State, they didn't want to do that. And we actually sent our people there, and they did a great job. And they were—they did it easily. But in the meantime, they went to other parts of the city, and they're doing damage. And we're recommending to the Governor that they call in national security, call in the National Guard. We're willing to get—we would stop that problem in one hour. We sent just defensive measures to protect and save that courthouse from being burned down or knocked down. We also saved a couple of other buildings—Federal buildings—because they were unable to do the job. I have to say this: They have really good police. They have a great group of people that, if they would be allowed to do their job—same with Chicago and same with New York and a couple of other cities—if they allowed—you have, in Chicago, 25,000 police, and they're really good, but they're not allowed to do their job. In New York, you have New York's Finest, but they've totally taken away their incentive. They've taken away their lives, in a sense, because they don't allow them to do their job. They could do that job so easily; you wouldn't have a problem in New York. And that includes with terrorism and everything else. They disbanded—they've cut by $1 billion their budget in New York. One billion dollars. And crime is up by 200 percent, 250 percent, depends on what week you're looking at. It's crazy what's going on in New York. We could solve that problem easily, but we don't have to, because they should be able to do it themselves. But they have to give the honor back. It's the—it's an honor. They have to give the honor back to their law enforcement groups. New York is great; so is Chicago. And in Portland, they could do the job. If they don't want to do that, we would send in—gladly, if they want—the National Guard will take care of it in 1 hour. It will go very quickly. Q. Mr. President, if I could—— Q. The President. As we did—by the way, if you take a look in Minneapolis, when they were burning down Minneapolis—a wonderful place but nobody's ever seen anything like it. After days, the very liberal mayor—and these are all run by liberal Democrats. Every place I talk about is run—because we have great cities, and they're run by Republicans. Okay? It's—you know, it's—there's no magic to it. It's obvious, what's going on. The President.  And these—the cities that I mentioned are all run by liberal—very liberal—Democrats. And it's very sad when you see what's happening to New York. It's very sad when you see what's happening to other cities, not just those three, other cities. And when you look at what's happening, it's not even believable. I left New York almost 4 years ago. And you could see signs of problems, because de Blasio was there. He's a horrific mayor, just horrific. I mean, people don't want to go there anymore. He's—not only is it bad with crime, I mean, the way he talks about the city and what he does. He's horrific. And when I see that, it's a very sad thing. I left almost 4 years ago, right? And when I look and see what's happening to a city that I love—that still has great potential, but it's going to have to be brought back. Because what happened in New York is—it's not even believable. What's happening in Chicago, where one weekend you have 78 people shot and 18 die—in a weekend. And then, successive weekends, you have so much of that happening. And it's not even—it's really not even believable. Q. Sir—— Q The President. And if you let Democrats run this country—and we've stopped it from going other places—if you let Democrats run this country, you'll have all of your cities be just like that. The President. Q. Mr. President—— Q. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. Yes, please. The President.  Federal Coronavirus Response/National Economy  Federal Coronavirus Response/National Economy  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The heads of the Boston and Dallas Fed, today, said that the economy hasn't recovered strong enough because the country hasn't contained the virus. So what's your response to them? And wouldn't that argue for a stronger Federal response? Q.  The President. Well, look, you just saw it. Other countries—we're doing much better than all other major countries, peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I'd say—see, it's that kind of a question—a wise-guy question—because I just went over the whole thing. We're doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we're—you know, we face a headwind because Democrats, perhaps for political reasons, don't want to open up their States. And that's having a huge toll—that's taking a huge toll on people within those States. The President. When you look at North Carolina, you have—a man doesn't want to open it up. You have—you look at Michigan, you look at some States—I mean, they just want to keep these people in their houses, in their prisons. They call them ""prisons."" And I think a lot of it is for political reasons, because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3. But I don't think it's going to matter because we're doing so well in so many ways. As far as the plague is concerned, when you look at the numbers, take a look at what's going on now with other countries, they're having flare-ups that are very, very substantial, and we've done very well. We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing, except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No, we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again, but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible. I think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we've had. And this is with California being closed down. This is where North Carolina and Michigan and tremendous States—great States—are being closed by—for reasons, I think, that would—that Scott would tell you—you would disagree with, right? You disagree with. He—we spent a great amount of time talking about it. We've got to open up our country. We understand the disease. We understand who it hits. We have to protect our elderly people, especially our elderly people that are not well. We have to protect them. But we understand it, and we understand it well. We've learned a lot. And we're going to have the vaccine soon, and we're going to have the therapeutic soon. Going to come out very soon, and we're very proud of the people and the job they've done. Yes, please. Go ahead. 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., and Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris  2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., and Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris just appeared together in their first campaign event, right before you've got up on this podium. Can you tell us if you watched their remarks and give us your reaction to them? Q.  The President. I didn't watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking, a moment of her speaking, and it was enough. The President. Look, he made a choice: He picked her. I watched her. I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing. And she left angry. She left mad. There was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman where she, I guess, believed the woman. And now all of a sudden, she's running to be Vice President, saying how wonderful he is. I thought it was a very unusual pick, because she said such bad things. And you know better than anybody what—you know, you won't write it because, you know, you don't want to do that—but you know better than anybody. She said horrible things about him. Horrible things. And she mocked him, openly mocked him. That's why I thought that was a very risky pick, because I'm sure that'll be played back—not necessarily by me, but others—it will be played back. The other thing, if you look, she wants a $3 trillion tax hike. No fracking. How do you think ""no fracking"" in Pennsylvania is going to play? That's a big fracking State. If you didn't have energy produced that way, you would have taxes that would triple, and you'd have unemployment that you wouldn't believe. And Pennsylvania, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Texas, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Oklahoma, best year. Almost every State in our Nation, last year, had the best year they've ever had. And they're going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what—but think of it: She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas. And then, I hear, ""Trump is only one point up in Texas."" No, they said the same thing with Crooked Hillary Clinton. They said: ""Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas."" And then, I won Texas. Immediately, when they said the polls are closed, ""Trump has won Texas."" And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It's the same thing over—it's almost like a duplication of what happened before, except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016, and we had a lot. We had record amounts in 2016. But you take a look at the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country, by far. Right? He wants to increase everybody's taxes. And she's one of the people that wants that. I mean, you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments. And you can't do that. You can't do that. It's actually got to be the opposite. I've been endorsed by so many police departments. I'm getting a really good one this week that you'll be seeing, really big, really good. But who could ever—what police department, what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden, where he said things that are so bad and so foolish—frankly, so stupid—in terms of crime and what would happen. So we're getting all of law enforcement. We're getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I've rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now. Much of the equipment is coming in, all made in the United States; $2.5 trillion, we spent. When I took over we had a military that was totally—it was in terrible, terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military: old planes, old tanks, old everything. And we have a beautiful, brandnew military with the best people in the world. We never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in. No, we have—we've done a real job. And I think we're going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her—very surprised—because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly, because she dropped like a rock. I didn't when I ran. I ran against 17 people, mostly Governors and Senators, some others. Ben Carson was very strong, very good. A couple of others, but mostly Governors, mostly Senators. And I ran, and I went up. She ran, and she went down to rock bottom. I don't think she ever got to run her first—to take a vote in her first—in the first State. And so, generally speaking, you don't want to pick somebody that went down, and she went down. But she went down in a very terrible way, and she said horrible things about Biden. She said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now she's running as Vice President. So how does that work? Please, in the back. School Reopening Efforts  School Reopening Efforts  Q. Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering tonight if you might have any words of encouragement for middle schoolers or high schoolers starting the school year strictly online who might be frustrated, wondering how they're going to get through the next quarter, missing their friends and teachers? Just wondering if you might have any words of encouragement for them. Q.  The President. It's such a fair question, such a good question. Yes, I mean, you hear what I was saying and what—Scott will be involved, and he'll be talking to you over the next couple of days—what he's saying from great experience. No, I feel very badly for them. And I have a feeling that on November 4, somebody is going to announce: ""Schools are open. The country is open. Everything is open."" I really believe a lot of it is done for political reasons, if you want to know the truth. I think so. The President. But you're right; online is not the same as being in the classroom. And that's been proven. It's been proven loud and clear. Yes. Any other questions? Q. Mr. President—— Q.  Q. On the economy, Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Go ahead. Go ahead, please. Please. The President. Public Housing/Demographic Composition of Suburbs/Zoning in Suburban Areas  Public Housing/Demographic Composition of Suburbs/Zoning in Suburban Areas  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You have sworn several times that if Joe Biden is elected President that there will be an invasion in suburban neighborhoods. It's a sentiment that you expressed in a—— Q.  The President. Yes. The President. Q. ——tweet again this morning. What exactly do you mean by ""invasion""? Q.  The President. What I mean is, people are going to become—they are going to be opening up areas of your neighborhood—which they're doing, and now they're going to do—they wanted to expand it. And they will expand it. If, for any reason—they're going to, in my opinion, destroy suburbia. The President. And just so you understand, 30 percent-plus of the people living in suburbia are minorities. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American—they're minorities. Thirty percent. The number is even higher, it's—they say 35, but I like to cut it a little bit lower. You know why? That way I can never get myself in too much trouble with the fake news. But 30 percent-plus are minorities living in suburbia. And when they go in and they want to change zoning so that you have lots of problems, where they want to build low-income housing—you want something where people can aspire to be there, not something where it gets hurt badly. And that's what happens. So, with suburban women, suburban men, I think they feel very strongly about what I'm doing. It's a very—I mean, it's a very fair question. It's a very important question. But they fought all their lives to be there, and then all of a sudden, they have—something happened that changes their life and changes what they fought for, for so many years. John [John Roberts, Fox News], please. ,  Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location  Republican Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech Location  Q. Quick—two quick ones, if I could, Mr. President. I know you were briefed on it; have you decided where are you're going to give your acceptance speech yet? Q.  The President. So we're looking at Gettysburg. The President. Q. I know that. Q.  The President. A magnificent site. I've been there a number of times. Just a magnificent site. And we're looking at the White House. And I would say it's really down to those two. The President. The White House would be a much easier, from the standpoint of Secret Service and, you know, the movement of hundreds of people, as you know. Q. Which way are you leaning? Q.  The President. I would say we love them both. I love Gettysburg, but it's—this is simpler. It would be magnificent. The White House is a—the White House is the White House. Gettysburg is one of the great and historic sites of our country—frankly, as far as I'm concerned, of the world. So one of those two. I'll probably be announcing it over the next week or so, maybe less. The President. Payroll Tax Cut  Payroll Tax Cut  Q. And then, I had a question about payroll taxes. If you permanently rescind the payroll tax, how do you pay for Social Security? Q.  The President. We're taking it out of the general fund. And what we'll do—— The President. Q. But that would incur huge deficits. Q.  The President. Yes, what we'll be doing is, if we do that, we'll get it approved, in that case, by Congress. And we'll take the money from other places, other than—we will not take it from Social Security in—— The President. Q. Right, but—— Q.  The President. ——any way shape or form. The President. — Q. How do you fund it from the general fund, when the general fund just incurred a debt of $2.8 trillion? Q.  The President. You're right, but we're going to have tremendous growth. We have tremendous growth. You take a look at what's happening here. The President. Next year—unless somebody comes in who doesn't know what they're doing and they start raising taxes and forcing everybody to leave the country or leave their jobs and companies to close—we will have tremendous growth. You will see growth like you haven't seen in a long time. Okay. Q. Mr. President, Mr. President—— Q. The President. Yes, please. The President. 2020 Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris/Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  2020 Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris/Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology  Q. Mr. President, since you didn't see Kamala Harris's remarks today, I wonder if we could just get you to respond to one thing that she said? Q.  The President. Sure. The President. Q. She said that your ""refusal to get testing up and running""; your—I'm paraphrasing—your ""flip-flopping on social distancing and masks""; and your ""delusional belief that you know better than the experts—all of that,"" in her words, are ""reason"" that one American dies of COVID-19 every minute. What do you think of that? Q.  The President. I think that's probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race, because she got her facts wrong. You know she's very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts. The President. And, just so you understand: We've done more testing than any country in the world, by far. That includes India, which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: ""Where do we get it? How do we get it?"" We have better testing than any country in the world. When you do as much testing as us, however, as you understand, you develop more cases. If you tested instead of 65 million people, which is what we've done—when you test that many people—you're going to find cases that normally you wouldn't see. If you go to Mexico and you go to other countries, you'll see they do almost no testing. They test if somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic. They test very little. They test very little. We've done more testing than anybody in the world. We've done the best job of any country in the world, and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We're supplying the whole world now, in a few short months, with ventilators that are very hard to produce, very expensive, very complex, very delicate, very, very important. We've done a great job. And then, on top of that, when you look at the numbers—how we were impacted less than these other countries. And now, you look at the explosion of countries that you would have said ""did such a good job,"" and some of them had advantages over us for obvious reasons, having to do with the pandemic. But when you look at the job that we've done compared to others, we've done a great job. And she—I read today that she's very short on facts. She—I think she's going to be a big failure. And I think—I look forward to the debate between her and Mike Pence, because I think he'll do even better against her than he did about—against Senator Kaine, which was a total wipeout. So we'll see how it all works out. Q. Mr. President—— Q. The President. All right, one more. The President.  Q. Mr. President—— Q.  The President. Yes, please, in the back. The President. Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. Q.  The President. Go ahead. The President. Q. Me? Q.  The President. You in the back, please. The President. 2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies  2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies  Q. Thank you. I'd just ask what do you say to those critics who argue you're trying to sow distrust in democracy and deliberately trying to sabotage the Post Office—to undermining mail-in voting, which a lot of people need? Q.  The President. Yes. I say the Democrats are sabotaging the Post Office because they're not approving $25 billion that was requested. So they're sabotaging the Post Office, and they're not allowing the Post Office to function properly, and they're certainly not allowing universal mail-in votes if—when they do that. The President. But equally importantly, they're not allowing $3.5 billion in funds to do voting that they'd like to do. Therefore all of this—and all of the tremendous mistakes that were made with regard to mail-in voting—all of these tremendous mistakes, you can't even—you can't even do it. I would imagine the courts—you know, this is in many courts right now. They're showing all of the disasters that have taken place just in the last short period of time—in the last 2 months—with respect to universal mail-in voting. It's just, like, a total catastrophe what's happening. And we can't let that happen. Go ahead, real fast. Go ahead. Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]. Q.  inaudible Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Q. Thank you very much. Two questions. One is about—you had graphs about the economics of COVID—— Q.  The President. Right. The President. Q. ——but deaths in America are still going up. Whereas in Europe, right now: zero deaths in U.K., zero deaths in France. Q.  The President. Yes. Well, it's going up by cases. If you look at cases. And the cases are going up because we do so much testing and we find it. And I call it ""fake-media gold"" because we do so much more testing than any other country. And when you do all that testing, you find cases. The President. Go ahead, Steve. Real fast. Go ahead. China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. A quick one on trade: You've got these trade talks with China going on. Is it possible you would pull out of the trade deal with China if they're not meeting their commitment? Q.  The President. We've taken a lot of money from China on the last year and a half that no other President has taken in. We've done things to China that nobody else has done to China, or even thought of doing—with 25-percent tariffs and taking in billions and billions of dollars—tens of billions of dollars. And giving them—giving the farmers, as an example, $12 billion one year, $16 billion another year—and made the farmers extremely happy. You don't hear them complaining. They were targeted by China. The President. But I'm very angry at China because they let this horrible disease—they let this horrible plague come into our country and come into the world. And they should have been able to stop it. They stopped it from going into China. They should have been able to stop it. So I'm very angry at China. Thank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1251"
"20","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 13, 2020        ","The President. Hello, everyone. Thank you very much. It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they've caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro—horribly shot—a young man, wonderful young man. And we have just—this just came out 2 minutes ago. So Attorney General Barr just announced.
 The President. As you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we're going to be helping out, and are in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime, in particular, certain types of crime. So that's really good news. They caught the killer of LeGend.
 Today we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people. That's what it is. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.
 Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans. You know that. He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early. If he had followed—if we went after—I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died. This is according to many people. I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that. He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.
 Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies. He wants to have ridiculous open borders. I've been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that, you have open borders, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, with open borders. So he wants open borders. The Democrats want open borders.
 And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through. The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it's having a huge impact. So we disagree with him on that. That's one of the many different—many things that we disagree with.
 But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the Federal Government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens.
 He wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of 3 straight months—I guess this just happened; he thinks it's good politics, I guess—no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings. Because different States are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem.
 He does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how Federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on Governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job, and they know what is needed.
 Also, many of our 50 States are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice. So I want to just say our Governors have worked very hard. They've worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that's been going. We have Scott now involved. And so, Scott, congratulations. You'll be working with a lot of Governors; you've already started. And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.
 If the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have? That's why he refused—Biden—to take questions. He couldn't answer any of them. Couldn't answer the questions. He refuses to take questions. He never takes questions. I take questions; he never takes questions. And you sort of wonder what's going on, because they're not that difficult. Some can be nasty, but they're not that difficult. But he never takes questions. So he just, I guess, left. I didn't see it, but I guess he just left the podium. Put it in your minds.
 My administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks. And I emphasized, this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they're great, and maybe they're just good. Maybe they're not so good. But frankly, what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. So we do, and we've been saying wear them when it's appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can't distance enough. And what do you have to lose?
 But again, it's up to the Governors. And we want to have a certain freedom. And we want to have a certain freedom. That's what we're about. At the same time, we also understand that each State is different and is facing unique circumstances. You have very, very different States facing very unique differences and circumstances.
 We've entrusted the Governors of each State, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the Federal Government and CDC. We're working with each State to implement a plan based on the facts and science. We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the Federal Government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal.
 Americans must have their freedoms. And I trust the American people and their Governors very much. I trust the American people. And the Governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn't. Joe doesn't. Joe doesn't know too much.
 Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science. That's why we're focused on protecting the high-risk Americans. That is why we're delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate. And that is why we're developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time. You'll see that, I think, very soon.
 Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to. I think I can speak for you. We've been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. But he wants them in the basement for months on end.
 And you have Governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their—wherever they may be—apartments. And frankly, I don't think the results are necessarily better than other results. But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt. And he wants it done by a Federal decree. This would lead to a crippling, long-lasting depression. This would be a crippling, long-lasting depression.
 And yesterday I showed you the numbers about how well we're doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we're back and very strong. It's a very strong ""V."" It's almost a straight-up ""V."" We'll be discussing that over the next couple of days.
 But the economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last 3 months are a record in history of our country. And we'll be back next year. I think we'll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market.
 By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record. And NASDAQ is actually a record over the last 14 days. Fourteen—for 14 times now, it's been record. And that's during what we hope will be the more final stages of the pandemic.
 So if we did what Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our health care system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including suicide, overdose, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms. It is very, very bad on the other side of the equation, when you do something like that. Those shutdowns are very punitive. Very punitive. They hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways through depression, through suicide, through so many other things: alcohol, drugs.
 Biden's approach is regressive, it's antiscientific, and it's very defeatist. It would be very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines—he has no clue—we've been solving problems and delivering tremendous results; the most advanced and robust testing system on the planet; the number-one producer of ventilators in the world, by far; unprecedented industrial mobilization—biggest since World War II—Operation Warp Speed to deliver lifesaving treatments and, very soon, a vaccine.
 What a plan by Joe Biden has actually laid out would do, we've really, already, accomplished. In fact, many of the things that was well reported over the last few days—every single thing he said to do, every single thing we did, and we did them well. So Biden has no idea on his own. He only knows what he thinks we should do, and he spews it out, and then he—I guess you could say he ""plagiarizes,"" and he really did in our case, because every single one of the events—I think, Kayleigh, we can say that—was something we had already done.
 So we'll defeat the virus, but not by hiding in our basements. He's got to come out of his basement. We'll defeat this virus through a commonsense mitigation effort, shielding those at highest risk, and unleashing America's medical and scientific genius, which is what it is. And we've already been doing it, and we're very close to having something that's going to be very, very special in the form of therapeutics and vaccines.
 To Joe, I would say: Stop playing politics with a virus. Too serious. Partisan politics has no place here. It's a shameful situation for anybody to try and score political points while we're working to save lives and defeat the pandemic.
 In times of national challenge, America has—and Americans—and we are—by the way, we are working with countries from all over the world, and they're trying to learn from us. And some of the countries that you spoke most well about are having a tremendous surge right now. But it will work out. But Americans must unite together, and they must put politics aside and have to really unite for a common good.
 Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. They're doing really well. We're producing the most promising vaccine candidates in advance, as you know, part of the largest industrialization ever. It's incredible, when I meet with heads of companies that are doing this—that are the best companies anywhere in the world—it's incredible where they are, how they're doing, and the speed with which they're doing it, and also the speed with which the FDA is approving things, because by any other standard, you would have been 2 or 3 years away from being at the point that we're at.
 By the end of this week, we will have shipped 1,846 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes, which are a very important source, as you know, for people that are not handling the plague from China very well. This week alone, we're sending 992 testing devices and 450,000 tests to more than 950 nursing homes across the country. And these tests are incredible. These are tests that are all new, very modern.
 And we're also getting on—the tests that are not done immediately, with the 5- to 15-minute timing, when they do send them to a lab, they're coming back now in 3 days. So it's a 3-day process, which is about as good as you can do. You have 1 day of delivering, 1 day of receiving, and 1 day in the lab. We're also requiring all nursing homes to test all members of their staff at least weekly.
 By unleashing America's scientific genius, we have delivered effective treatments. The case fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by about 85 percent. That's a fantastic number. It's declined. That's case fatality. It's declined by 85 percent.
 Europe has seen 40-percent more excess mortality than the United States compared to a nonpandemic year. So you hear the numbers, and those numbers are very interesting, but that's the way it is.
 We continue to urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when necessary and when you cannot distance, and protect—very importantly—the vulnerable. Protect people that are older and especially people that have problems with heart or diabetes or some other problem.
 Earlier today very exciting news—very big news all over the world; they're talking about it all over the world; it was amazing—we finalized a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. After half a century, Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. Nobody thought this was something that could happen for a long time. This is the most important diplomatic breakthrough since the Egypt-Israel peace agreement; it was signed over 40 years ago.
 We have Ambassador to Israel David Friedman here. Thank you, David, for being here. We very much—you would agree that this was a big day for Israel and a big day for the world?
 U.S. Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman. You're right.
 U.S. Ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman. The President. Good. Thank you, David. You've been fantastic too. Fantastic Ambassador and representative of our country. Thank you very much.
 The President. The deal that was reached today will enable Muslims to have far greater ability to visit many historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is very important to them, which they've wanted to have access to for many, many decades.
 This is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East. And I think you're going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you we already do, and they want to make a deal. They're going to have peace in the Middle East. It will be fantastic.
 Israel is also suspending settlements in the West Bank, which is a big deal, a bold step toward achieving peace. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have also agreed to immediately expand and accelerate scientific collaboration to develop effective treatments and vaccines to defeat the China virus—they've both been hit; virtually, every country has been hit, 188 countries—and to save lives in their region and in their world. So they are working very much on the vaccines, also with us. And, again, some very good news is going to take place with respect to that.
 Our unprecedented diplomatic engagements laid the groundwork for this historic peace agreement, which was just announced a little while ago, today.
 We will not rest as we continue to work toward a world of greater harmony and prosperity for all. I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates—two fantastic people—for their vision and their leadership. And I look forward to hosting them at the White House very soon to formally sign the agreement. We'll probably be doing it over the next, I would say, 3 weeks. And they'll be coming to Washington.
 So that was a tremendous day. That was a tremendous thing that happened. And it's a great sign. We have a lot of other interesting things going on with other nations, also having to do with peace agreements. And a lot of big news is coming over the next few weeks, and I'm sure you'll be very impressed. And more importantly, it's a great thing for our country, a great thing for the world. So thank you very much.
 Please, go ahead.
 School Reopening Efforts 
 School Reopening Efforts  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. I want to ask you about school-aged kids and food. One of the real problems when you shut down the schools: These are kids on reduced and free lunch programs; they need these meals to make it through their day. And with districts shutting down school, what, if anything, can the Federal Government do to make sure that the kids still get decent meals, as long as the schools are out?
 Q.  The President. Well, you know we don't want the schools shut down. We want the schools to open. And especially very young children handle it—children, all children—but especially very young children handle it very well. So we want schools open. We don't want to be in that position. We want schools open. We've made payment. And we would, frankly, if the school isn't going to open, we would much rather follow the child with the payment——
 The President. Q. Right.
 Q. The President. ——give the money to the child, meaning the parents of the child, and let that—let the parents do what they have to do, including bringing the child to another school, because we're finding that whether it's parents or children, people want to get back to school. They want to have their life back.
 The President. —— Some people say they don't want—the Democrats don't want schools open, because that's where you have a lot of polling booths. And if you have a school closed, you can't very easily have polling booths at the school. And that's becoming—I think maybe we'll be able to show that as fact, but that's another thing that they're doing to try and keep people away from the polls. So we have to look into that, but it's—you've been reading about it, I've been reading about it, and I don't like it.
 But we'd like to see the schools open. Then, we don't have that problem.
 Good question.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. The President. Thank you. Please, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters].
 The President.  Arab-Israeli Peace Process 
 Arab-Israeli Peace Process  Q. Mr. President, what's your understanding of how long Israel will suspend this West Bank annexation plan?
 Q.  The President. What do you think? Tell me.
 The President. Ambassador Friedman. Well, we have—we're putting all our eggs into the basket of peace. We have an agreement with the Emirates. We're going to nail down all the details—Embassies, overflights, commercial—and then we're going to extrapolate that to the rest of the region. How long that takes, I can't tell you. But that's—we've prioritized peace over the sovereignty movement, but it's not off the table. It's just something that will be deferred until the—we give peace every single chance.
 Ambassador Friedman. Q. And to follow up, what do you want the Palestinians to take away from this deal, since they're not really a party to it?
 Q.  The President. Well, but they are supported largely by some of the countries that we're talking to and that have already signed—you know, in the case of the one country. But others will be following. And I think the Palestinians will—without saying it necessarily yet, I think they very much want to be a part of what we're doing. And I see, ultimately, the Palestinians—I see peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I see that happening. I think as these very big, powerful, wealthy countries come in, I think the Palestinians will follow, quite naturally.
 The President. Yes, please.
 Israel-United Araba Emirates Relations 
 Israel-United Araba Emirates Relations  Q. Do you believe that a deal could have been reached without Israel's agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?
 Q.  The President. Say it again. Could you make it louder?
 The President. Q. Do you believe that a deal could have been reached without Israel's agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?
 Q.  The President. What do you think about that, David? It's interesting.
 The President. Ambassador Friedman. I think you can't do both at the same time. So I think, again, prioritize peace. Sovereignty after peace is given; every opportunity to return to sovereignty. I don't think the two could have been done at the same time.
 Ambassador Friedman. Q. And have you asked Israel to permanently consider abandoning annexation———
 Q.  Ambassador Friedman. No, this is a temporary process. There's been no request.
 Ambassador Friedman. The President. Okay? Please, Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN].
 The President. U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. This morning you said that you do not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are trying to expand voting by mail. So I've got two questions for you. One, are you threatening to veto any legislation that includes funding for the Post Office?
 Q.  The President. No, not at all. No.
 The President. Q. So you would sign something that does include funding?
 Q.  The President. Sure. A separate thing, I would do it. But one of the reasons the Post Office needs that much money is they have all of these millions of ballots coming in from nowhere, and nobody knows from where and where they're going. You saw what happened in—Kaitlan—in Virginia. It was, you know, 500,000 applications coming in, going all over the State; nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. And you see Paterson, New Jersey, what's going on there. And we can give you many other locations and sites.
 The President. What has happened is that's part of a big negotiation. That's a—actually small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault. And Post Office is part of it. Another part of it is, they want $3½ billion just for the ballots themselves. Why it's so much, I don't know. But that's what the Democrats want. But if the bill isn't going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn't going to get funded, and that would also mean that the $3½ billion dollars isn't going to be taken care of. So I don't know how you can possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots.
 Absentee ballots, by the way, are fine. But the universal mail-ins that are just sent all over the place, where people can grab them and grab stacks of them and sign them and do whatever you want, that's the thing we're against.
 Q. But isn't that precisely the problem, is that you're saying you do not want to give this Post Office funding in this coronavirus legislation? They say they need it so they can be prepared; so if the pandemic is still going on in November when the election happens and people don't feel safe to go vote in person, they can vote by mail, and it can be safe, and it can be secure.
 Q.  The President. I can understand the Post Office. And if we could agree to a bill—the overall bill, which is obviously a much bigger number than just the Post Office—that would be fine. But they have the Post Office as one of their requests. It's their request.
 The President. Q. Right. But this morning you said you were against it, didn't you?
 Q.  The President. I'm only against—what I'm against is, I'm against doing anything where the people aren't taken care of, and the people aren't being taken care of properly. We have—we want people to get money. It wasn't their fault that they got shut down. They got shut down by China.
 The President. So whether it's the Post Office or whether it's the $3½ billion dollars—you know, they're asking for $3½ billion dollars just for the universal mail-in ballots, but they're not willing to make a deal. These are two points within a very big deal.
 The thing they want more than anything else, Kaitlan—and you know this—is bailout money for the States and for the cities that are in trouble, which, for the most part, are Democrat-run States and cities. So New York has a problem, California has a problem, Illinois has a tremendous problem, and others. They want to be able to bail out these States, and we don't want to be doing that or certainly don't want to do it to the extent. They're looking for $1 trillion; we don't want to be doing that.
 Q. But this morning—I'm just——
 Q.  The President. Please go ahead.
 The President. Potential Voter Fraud Risks/2020 Presidential Election 
 Potential Voter Fraud Risks/2020 Presidential Election  Q. I'm just really confused, because this morning you said they need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all these millions and millions of ballots, and you said that would be ""fraudulent."" So it sounded like you said you're blocking——
 Q.  The President. No, no. No, no. I said it will end up being fraudulent, because if you look at what's happened over the last few weeks—just look at the few instances where this has happened—it's turned out to be fraudulent.
 The President. Q. There's no widespread evidence of fraud though.
 Q.  The President. Well, if you look at New York, it was fraudulent; if you look at Paterson, New Jersey, it was fraudulent.
 The President. Q. There's no evidence of fraud.
 Q.  The President. Of course, there is. The whole thing is a mess. In fact, Carolyn Maloney's opponent is—he's gone crazed. He said they took the election away from him, and he may be right. I think they should redo that election. And if you look at Virginia, it's terrible. Look at some of the things that have happened in California. Look at California, where they found a million noneligible voters. That was done by Judicial Watch—Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch.
 The President. We have to have an honest election. And if it's not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it. But if the Post Office——
 Q. What do you mean by that?
 Q.  The President. ——if they're not going to approve a bill and the Post Office, therefore, won't have the money, and if they're not going to approve a big bill, a bigger bill, and they're not going to have the $3½ billion dollars for the universal mail-in votes, how can you have those votes?
 The President.  What it would mean is, the people will have to go to the polls and vote, like the old days—like 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago. They have to go to the—it doesn't say anybody is taking the vote away, but it means that the universal mail-ins don't work. Absentees do work. It's a very different thing—an absentee—where you make an application, and you send it in, they send you a vote. It's different.
 But—so, Kaitlan, I'm not saying anything wrong with voting. I want them to vote. But that would mean that they'd have to go to a voting booth, like they used to, and vote.
 Q. Even if they don't feel safe voting in person? People want to vote by mail because of the pandemic.
 Q.  The President. Well, they're going to have to feel safe, and they will be safe, and we will make sure that they're safe. And we're not going to have to spend $3½ billion dollars to do it.
 The President. And when you go to a voting—it would be wonderful if we had voting ID. And some States have that, and some States don't because they can't get it passed. Most States want it. But we want people to vote. We want people to vote so when they vote, it means one vote; it doesn't mean ballots all over the place.
 You saw what would—what was happening in Virginia, where piles of ballot applications are dropped all over the State. They had them named after dogs. They had them named after dead people. We want to have an accurate vote. I'm not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage, I don't know. I can't tell you that.
 But I do know this: I just want an accurate vote—and it's a fair question, by the way—and so does everybody else.
 Q. Just to follow up——
 Q.  The President. Yes, in the back.
 The President. Treatment of Christians in the Middle East 
 Treatment of Christians in the Middle East  Q. Mr. President, how does the accord today between Israel and the U.A.E. help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East?
 Q.  The President. Help what?
 The President. Q. How does it help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East, the deal today?
 Q.  The President. Well, I think it's going to. I think it's a big start. And you're right about that: Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East. And I think this is a big start. It's going to be a very strong start, very powerful start, and it's something that I will tell you—I've told David, and I've told every one of our negotiators: If you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, it's beyond disgraceful. It's—if I had information and if I had absolute proof—some of the stories that we've heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get—I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn't believe. What they do to Christians in the Middle East—and it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful. You're right.
 The President. It's a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in—for instance, U.A.E. has agreed very strongly to represent us; I think they will very well with respect to Christianity, because in the Middle East, it's not treated well. It's not treated well at all. It's treated horribly and very unfairly, and it's criminal what's happened, and that's for many, many years.
 I think it's a great question and very—it's a very unfair situation.
 Please, go ahead.
 TikTok/China-U.S. Trade 
 TikTok/China-U.S. Trade  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Larry Kudlow said that there's a routine check-in call with China on the phase one trade deal. My question is: What if they bring up TikTok and also WeChat? Would you engage—would you instruct your team to engage them on that Executive order you just signed?
 Q.  The President. No, we have a deadline of September 15. And whether it's Microsoft, I understand—and others are negotiating—we also said that, obviously, it's worthless if we don't allow them into the country, so we said that the United States Treasury is going to be getting something out of this deal—something very substantial.
 The President. But what we want is total security, but we have a deadline of September 15. So I know Microsoft and others are very interested in it, but that's our deadline. And it has to be proven to be totally secure. We don't want to have any information going into China with what we've been through.
 And I have to tell you—you talk about the deal—you mentioned the phase one deal. Well, the phase one deal, it's a very interesting situation because you've been hearing, ""the largest order of corn in history,"" ""the largest order of soybeans,"" ""the largest order of beef."" They've done more than they've ever done.
 So you're going to have to figure that one out. With where I'm coming from, I could have—because they see my attitude. My attitude toward China is not friendly. But they have gone into orders that are extremely large, extremely large, and our farmers are very happy.
 But with what they did with respect to the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, it just is a different feeling. It's an incredible deal, but I have a very different feeling.
 Q. So you are——
 Q. The President. But they are giving—they are giving the Midwest, our farmers, among the largest orders they've ever seen. Somebody told me today—Bob Lighthizer said about 40 percent of the—of what they're selling now is going to China. So maybe they're trying to make me change my mind a little bit, because you know my attitude on China, and it's not—it hasn't been very good.
 The President.  Q. But you're willing to—[inaudible]—TikTok with them in these negotiations?
 Q.  inaudible The President. Well, we're not talking to them. No, we're talking to the companies. In theory, it's a company, but it's a company within China. That means China. And the deal will have to be substantially beneficial to the United States, and we need total security. Okay?
 The President. Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please. Israel's Proposed Annexation of West Bank Territories 
 The President. Israel's Proposed Annexation of West Bank Territories  Q. Mr. President, can you say whether you yourself think that annexation should be off the table for Israel? And if so, have you communicated that to the Prime Minister?
 Q.  The President. Well, not off the table. No. It's something they've discussed, but Israel has agreed not to do that. I mean, more than just off the table, they have agreed not to do it. And I think that was very important, and I think it was a great concession by Israel, and I think it was a very smart concession by Israel.
 The President. But, David, do you have anything further to add on that?
 Q. The Prime Minister was pretty clear today at his own press conference that he considers this to be a temporary suspension and that the deal would still be open to him at some point in the future. I'm asking what you think he should do. Should he actually write it off?
 Q.  The President. No, right now all I can say: It's off the table. So I can't talk about some time into the future; that's a big statement. But right now it's off the table. Is that a correct statement, Mr. Ambassador?
 The President. Ambassador Friedman. Yes. The word ""suspend"" was chosen carefully by all the parties. ""Suspend,"" by definition—look it up—that means ""temporary halt."" It's off the table now, but it's not off the table permanently.
 Ambassador Friedman. The President. Go ahead.
 The President. U.S. Postal Service/Economic Stimulus Legislation/Vote-by-Mail Policies 
 U.S. Postal Service/Economic Stimulus Legislation/Vote-by-Mail Policies  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. Just to follow on some of the questions that Kaitlan was asking. You said you do want an accurate vote.
 Q.  The President. That's right.
 The President. Q. Would you direct the Postmaster General to reverse some of the policies changes——
 Q.  The President. No, not at all.
 The President. Q. ——that have occurred there, in order to prevent delays?
 Q.  The President. No, I wouldn't do that at all. No, I want the Post Office to run properly. But—which makes sense, they would need a lot more money if they're going to be taking in tens of millions of ballots that just come out of the sky from nowhere. And so they need additional financial help.
 The President. It's a part of the bill that the Democrats don't want to make, because they want a trillion—much bigger part of the bill—they want a trillion dollars to go to States that are run by Governors, who happen to be Democrats, who have not done a good job for many, many years. And those are States that owe a lot of money and need a lot of money, and they're talking about $1 trillion.
 So the Post Office and the $3½ billion dollars for the votes themselves, which sounds like a lot of money they're looking for—$3½ billion dollars. Think of that: $3½ billion to have mail-in ballots.
 Again, absentee, good; universal mail-in, very bad.
 Please. Go ahead.
 Q. Just taking a step back, one quick follow-up. Given that the negotiations are still ongoing about whether to get more money to the Postal Service, why not put more resources and more money, yourself—find a way to do that to make sure there is a free and fair election? The President. Well, they can do it very easily. All they have to do is make a deal. If they make a deal, the Postal Service is taken care of, the money they need for the mail-in ballots would be taken care of—if we agree to it. That doesn't mean we're going to agree to it. But all they have to do is make a deal.
 Q.  The President. But again, more important to them is not that. That's a lot of money, but it's small time compared to the other. What they want to do—and very, very, very strongly what they want to do is bail out cities that are run by Democrats and have been for many years. And these cities and States have done very badly, and they desperately need money for that.
 And we're open to something, but we're not open to the kind of money that they need.
 Go ahead, please.
 Q. My question for you is just, Mr. President——
 Q.  Q. Mr. President, 3½ years, sir——
 Q.  Q. Very quickly, my question for you is just what are you doing——
 Q.  Q. Three and a half years——
 Q.  The President. Just 1 second. Please, go ahead.
 The President. Q. What are you doing as President to make sure there is a free and fair election?
 Q.  The President. That do what?
 The President. Election Security 
 Election Security  Q. What are you doing, as President, to make sure there is a free and fair election?
 Q.  The President. So, everyone talks about ""Russia, Russia, Russia."" They talk about ""China, China."" They talk about all of these different countries that come in and run our elections, which is false.
 The President. But what they do—what they don't talk about are things like very loose mail-in ballots, universal in nature, that, frankly, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran—all of these countries that we are reading about, hearing about, and, in some cases, they're writing about, intelligence-wise—these countries can grab those ballots or print forgeries of those ballots, and they would go out, and they would have a field day.
 This is the easiest way for—the mail-in ballots is the easiest way for a country like a China or Russia or a North Korea or Iran—I hear Iran too. You know, that was part of the report. This would be very easy for them. This is much easier than——
 Q. What are you doing to make sure it's free and fair?
 Q.  The President. Well, we have been very strong. Now, if you remember, President Obama was informed about Russia by the FBI in September. The election was in November. President Obama decided to do absolutely nothing about it. People don't mention that very much anymore. That's a lost fact. But he was informed very powerfully that they're going to do—and President Obama did nothing. We have done a lot, and we've really shored it up.
 The President. But what people can never prepare for are millions and millions of mail-in ballots. Because they can be forged. They can be captured. They can be taken.
 Q. There's no evidence of that, so——
 Q.  The President. No, that's a very hard thing to do. We have to make sure that we can do that.
 The President. Please. Q. Sir, Mr. President, after 3½ years, do you regret, at all, all the lying you've done to the American people on everything?
 Q.  The President. All the what?
 The President. Q. All the lying. All the dishonesties.
 Q.  The President. That who has done?
 The President. Q. You have done. Tens of thousands——
 Q.  The President. Yes, go ahead. Please. Please.
 The President. Go ahead.
 Payroll Tax Cut 
 Payroll Tax Cut  Q. I wanted to ask about the payroll tax cut.
 Q.  The President. Go ahead.
 The President Q. One, is it going to be optional or mandatory for employers to defer and not collect the payroll tax?
 Q.  The President. So we'll——
 The President. Q. And I have a follow-up on that.
 Q.  The President. The payroll tax is very important and a very big benefit to people; as you know, to companies, because we want the companies to be strong—but now, directly to people. And it's a very big number. And we're taking care of it. And we—this will go directly to the people, to workers within the company. It's a payroll tax. It's called a payroll tax cut. We're cutting the payroll tax. And it's a very large number, and that will go directly to the workers of the company.
 The President. Q. But will the—if employers collect that through FICA, will that be—are they going to be required not to collect that money? Or is it——
 Q.  The President. The—you mean later on? You mean later on, at a later date?
 The President. Q. Well, right now. So on September 1, when I get my paycheck, will it be up to my——
 Q.  The President. The employers—the employers will collect it and give it, most likely. The employers will collect it and give it. Okay?
 The President. Q. But can I ask a follow-up on that?
 Q.  The President. Please, go ahead.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, I have two questions. The first one on domestic politics. There are claims——
 Q.  The President. Can't—can't understand a word you're saying.
 The President. Democratic Vice President Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris 
 Democratic Vice President Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris  Q. There are claims circulating on social media that Kamala Harris is not eligible to be—to run for Vice President because she was an ""anchor baby,"" I quote. Do you or can you definitively say whether or not Kamala Harris is eligible—legal—and meets the legal requirements to run as Vice President?
 Q.  The President. So I just heard that. I heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements. And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that's right. I would have—I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for Vice President.
 The President. Q. [Inaudible]
 Q.  Inaudible The President. But that's a very serious—you're saying that—they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country?
 The President. Q. She was.
 Q.  Q. No, she was born in this country, but her parents did not—the claims say that her parents did not receive their permanent residence at that time.
 Q.  The President. Yes, I don't know about it. I just heard about it. I'll take a look.
 The President. Back in the back, please.
 United Nations General Assembly 
 United Nations General Assembly  Q. Okay. Mr. President, a follow-up on UNGA. Ambassador Kelly Craft recently said that you—or she's hoping that you might be able to deliver the speech in front of the U.N. General Assembly in person, even though other leaders will be sending in their video recordings. Can you confirm that?
 Q.  The President. Yes, I'm thinking about going directly to the U.N. to do the speech. A lot of people will not, because of COVID—will not be able to be there, as you know. But I'm thinking—I think it's appropriate. If we can do it, I'll do it directly. And again, this will not be like in the past, because some countries won't be able to escape the problems they're having. You know, countries are having a tremendous problem with the China virus. So we'll see what happens.
 The President. But I would prefer doing it. I can do it the other way. I can do it ""viral,"" as they say. I can do it in that form. But I'd rather be at the United Nations—deliver it.
 Q. Would you do it if the room was empty?
 Q.  The President. I think it—I think it better represents the country. Also, I feel, sort of, a—at least a semiobligation as the President of the United States to be at the United Nations to deliver what will be an important speech.
 The President. Q. Would you still do it if the room was empty?
 Q.  The President. Well, the room won't be empty. The room will have different people there and representatives of countries. But I can understand how it's, you know—it's very difficult for countries to be there. They won't be there only for that reason. They'd love to be there. I've already had people call. In fact, say—a couple of them—""I'd love to be there. If you want, I'll be there."" I said, ""Don't be there. You don't have to be there.""
 The President. No, the room would be—I think the room will not be—although, there may be a spacing requirement like you have in this room. This room was always packed. This room would be packed again if we had the seats open. But you have a spacing requirement, so I understand that the United Nations, they may have that too.
 Yes, please.
 Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question on the peace deal, but if you don't mind, could I defer my question to Emel Akan from Epoch Times.
 Q.  The President. Sure. Yes. Please.
 The President. Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. The President. Thank you.
 Q.  The President. Hong Kong/China 
 Hong Kong/China  Q. I would like to ask your opinion about what recently happened in Hong Kong, the recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong. And Jimmy Lai was arrested; his newsroom was raided. What—how will the U.S. respond to this?
 Q.  The President. Well, I think it's a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done—you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won't be, because we've taken all of the incentives away.
 The President. If you look at China—with the World Trade Organization, as an example—they're getting tremendous, because they're considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we're not? And they get tremendous incentives.
 We have—by the way, I told them it's unacceptable, and we've been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.
 We've now withdrawn all of those incentives. It's going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States—and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it—will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We've withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong, because freedom is a great thing.
 Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1255"
"21","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 14, 2020        ","The President. Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. So we have some very interesting news. Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey's very corrupt FBI, is expected to plead guilty. You probably heard that. It just came out. So that's just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again. So he is pleading guilty. Terrible thing. Terrible thing. The fact is, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. And you'll be hearing more.
 The President. Today the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War II, in our fight against the China virus.
 New factories, businesses, and laboratories are being built all over America to match our Nation's demand for personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics, and vaccines. It's been incredible what we've been able to do in a very short period of time. We're helping other countries also, because we've been really—we've been doing it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
 It was just announced, a little while ago, industrial production rose for the third straight month. It's a big thing. Factory output was up 3.4 percent this month after a 5.7 increase last month. Those are getting to be record numbers. And manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70 percent. So we're coming back very strong. We should have a very good third quarter. We should have an unbelievably good next year. Next year, if we don't mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they're doing, it could be a fantastic year.
 My administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number—and a—related authorities—at a—78 times, dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. So, put it a little bit differently: The administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times. That's a lot, Peter, right? It's a big number: 78 times. It came in very handy. A lot of times, we just mentioned it, and they did what we asked them to do. Dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials.
 I've used the DPA more comprehensively than any President in history. There was a time when the media would say: ""Why aren't you using it? Why aren't you using it?"" Well, we have used it a lot, where necessary. Only where necessary. For the most part, we've had tremendous cooperation.
 By invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators. GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana, plant in just 17 days—an alltime record—and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators.
 We're also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month in Michigan. They've done a great job. Our Nation is now the king of ventilators. I say that: the king of ventilators. We're sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators. And it's—really, I guess we're looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year. Those are some numbers. So we're helping a lot of countries. In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks. By May, they had increased production by over a million masks a day. Think of that: They increased production of masks by over 1 million a day. 3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month. We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island. They're now producing over 20 million masks a month.
 By the end of the year, domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over 1 billion N95 respirators, and all of them are made right here in the U.S.A. That's a big difference from the past. Overall, we've increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year. Now, the media might say: ""Why not 500? Why not 600?"" Nobody has seen numbers like this ever.
 We delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine. I was up there. I was—as you remember, we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads on the way to Puritan Medical. Puritan has doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million per month. They're doing a fantastic job, and so is Maine.
 I've also used the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding. My administration located and seized over a half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment, including 299,000 pairs of medical-grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators, and 130,000 surgical masks. That's hoarding.
 My administration's decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results. People have done an incredible job. We've replenished the Strategic National Stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration. Since the start of the pandemic, we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million, and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.
 By September, the Strategic National Stockpile inventory is on track to contain over 300,000—excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves, and over 190,000 ventilators. That's far more than we've done before. It's not even close.
 As we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America's industrial might. We're bringing jobs to the U.S.A. We understand that the economic health is critical—very critical—to public health. We'll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have, compared to any other country. There is no country even close when you look at what we've done compared to them on the—from the standpoint of the economy and also during—even during the period of the China virus.
 In the last 3 months, we've added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day. We've also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past 3 months. That's despite people saying, ""You can't do manufacturing jobs anymore."" You'd ""need a magic wand,"" they said, but they were wrong. Weekly jobless claims just fell below 1 million for the first time in a long time.
 I'm pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Federal Government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation—great company, which is a major medical supplier—to rapidly distribute a China-virus vaccine as soon as one is approved—fully approved. They're in stage three trials. We have many of them going along different passes. Also many different companies doing them, very, very incredible companies.
 We currently have three candidates in phase three clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter. And we're ready, logistically, to distribute them. Our military is ready. We have a great general who's in charge. That's what he does, is he distributes things; usually, it's people and weapons, tanks, but in this case, it's a vaccine or a therapeutic, as it may be. We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding. As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable, and we will be watching always very carefully. Remain vigilant.
 We ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible, and to protect the elderly. Always protect the elderly.
 So now we'll take a few questions if you'd like. Let's see.
 John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.
 U.S. Postal Service/Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 U.S. Postal Service/Executive Action on Coronavirus Relief/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, on the issue of more money for the U.S. Postal Service and mail-in balloting——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——if the Democrats were to give you some of what you want, which you articulated in a series of tweets in the last hour, would you be willing to accept the $25 billion for the Postal Service, including the $3½ billion to handle mail-in voting?
 Q.  The President. Sure, if they give us what we want. And it's not what I want, it's what the American people want.
 The President. So in addition to—and I just—I think, John, as part of your answer, I can read this: But in addition to the Executive orders that we signed, which are going to be doing terrific things in terms of payroll tax cut, which is a lot of money coming to a lot of people very quickly, I've directed the Secretary of the Treasury to get ready and send direct payments—$3,400 for a family of four—to all Americans. Democrats are holding this up. I am ready to have the UST and SBA send additional PPP payments to small businesses that have been hurt by the China virus. Democrats are holding this up.
 So we're talking about—those are two things directly involved and, really, victim of the China virus. We're ready to send; Democrats are holding up. I'm ready to send rental assistance payments to hard-working Americans that have been hurt by the China virus. All of these things are in a list. Democrats are holding this up.
 I'm ready to send $105 billion to the States to help open schools safely, with additional PPP—E. And Democrats are holding this up. So that's $105 billion to the States to help open schools safely, with additional PPE. Democrats are holding that up. Right?
 And I'm ready to send more money to States and local governments to save jobs of our great police, our firefighters, our first responders and teachers. It's all ready to go. Democrats are holding it up. So they're holding, John, all of that up.
 Q. So if they were to give you that——
 Q.  The President. Yes, if they would do it.
 The President. Q. ——you would sign off for the money for the Postal Service?
 Q.  The President. Yes, but they're not giving it to me, they're giving it to the American people. I mean, giving it——
 The President. Q. But if they were to agree with that.
 Q.  The President. Yes, I would—I would certainly do that. Sure, I would do that.
 The President. Q. Do you have a—— The President. Yes.
 Q. The President.  Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, I just want to follow up on that, and then a quick question. Just when you said that you've directed Secretary Mnuchin to ready direct payments, are you— speaking about something you're going to do independently or that you're just waiting for the legislative package?
 Q.  The President. I'm waiting for the Democrats to approve it. Okay?
 The President. Georgia Republican Congressional Candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene 
 Georgia Republican Congressional Candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene  Q. Okay. And then, I wanted to ask you, you congratulated Marjorie Taylor Greene in a tweet. You called her a future Republican star. Greene has been a proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory. She said that's something that should be—would be worth listening to. Do you agree with her on that?
 Q.  The President. Well, she did very well in the election. She won by a lot. She was very popular. She comes from a great State. And she had a tremendous victory, so absolutely, I did congratulate her.
 The President. Please. Go ahead.
 Q. But specifically—specifically on QAnon——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. ——and her decision to embrace that conspiracy theory, do you agree with her on that? That was the question.
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Health of the President's Brother Robert S. Trump/Russia/Iran 
 Health of the President's Brother Robert S. Trump/Russia/Iran  Q. I just wanted to ask you what ails your brother Robert, and how is he doing?
 Q.  The President. Yes. I have a wonderful brother. We've had a great relationship for a long time, for—from day one. It's a long time ago. And he's in the hospital right now, and hopefully, he'll be all right. But he's pretty—he's having a hard time.
 The President. Q. I wanted to ask you——
 Q.  The President. He's terrific.
 The President. Q. ——also really quickly about Putin's invitation to join a video summit with Iran and other world powers. Would you accept that invitation?
 Q.  The President. I haven't been told of it yet. I heard there's something, but I haven't been told of it yet.
 The President. Please, go ahead.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. Potential Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Russia's Coronavirus Vaccine Development Efforts 
 Potential Coronavirus Vaccine Deployment/Russia's Coronavirus Vaccine Development Efforts  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions on vaccines: First, once a vaccine is ready, who should get it first? The President. I will rely on the doctors to tell me that. I would say probably the elderly. I would say nursing homes. A lot of people said, ""Would you take it?"" I said: ""I'll take it if they want, or I'll go first or last. I'll do whatever they want me to do."" But I would think that the elderly, the people that are most vulnerable to the disease. And we're actually making those lists right now, mostly nursing homes and retirement centers. Yes.
 Q.  The President. Q. Second, Russia has approved a vaccine. What do you know about the vaccine? And have you spoken to Russian officials about it?
 Q.  The President. We don't know much about it. We hope it works; we do. We hope it works. They cut off certain trials, and we just feel it's important to go through the process. We have numerous different vaccines that we think are going to work, but we want to go through a system of trials. We're very advanced. We're very—we'll be announcing something in the not-too-distant future, also with therapeutics, which I think are very, very important.
 The President. Yes, please.
 WeChat/China-U.S. Relations 
 WeChat/China-U.S. Relations  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. I had two—one on China and then one on oil. The first one on China: There's a lot of alarm among American companies about your order on WeChat. Apple, Ford, Disney—they're worried because it's such a big communications platform and a payment platform in China that if you ban U.S. businesses from working with them, that they won't be able to sell, you know, iPhones into China or similar markets.
 Q.  The President. Whatever.
 The President. Q. So you don't mind if this——
 Q.  The President. I do what's good in terms of the security of our country.
 The President. Q. So has Congress——
 Q.  The President. We've been very badly let down by China. What's your next question?
 The President. U.S. Seizure of Iranian Oil Tankers 
 U.S. Seizure of Iranian Oil Tankers  Q. On oil: The U.S. this week seized four Iranian——
 Q.  The President. Right.
 The President. Q. ——oil tankers going towards Venezuela.
 Q.  The President. Yes. Not supposed to do that.
 The President. Q. Wondering—yes, they're going to go to Houston. I'm wondering what you're going to do with that oil and if this is something——
 Q.  The President. We'll be announcing. We have four tankers. They going to Houston, and they're there. We—they're not supposed to be doing that. Iran is not supposed to be doing that. And so we did—we seized the tankers, and we're moving them, and moved, to Houston.
 The President. Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris 
 Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. Two questions, if you don't mind, Mr. President. First of all, Kamala Harris—you've been very blunt about how you feel about her: ""mean, nasty, mad woman."" Biden now saying——
 Q.  The President. No, I haven't been blunt. I said, ""She treated Joe Biden worse than anybody else."" I watched those debates. They were very boring, but they were debates nevertheless. And I watched, you know, pretty good parts of them, and she treated Biden worse than anybody else, by far. There was nobody—including Pocahontas—nobody treated Biden so badly as Kamala.
 The President. Q. Well, let me ask you this then: Do you have an issue with a strong woman of color being in this Presidential race? Do you see——
 Q.  The President. None whatsoever.
 The President. Q. You don't see her as a threat?
 Q.  The President. As you—as you know, none whatsoever. No, not at all.
 The President. Economic Stimulus Legislation/Crime 
 Economic Stimulus Legislation/Crime  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. And a stimulus question, if you don't mind: You have told me—even before you were President, you always talked about being the ultimate dealmaker. Why not just sit down with Democrats personally and cut a deal?
 Q.  The President. Because they want $1 trillion to go to their friends doing a bad job running certain cities and States that are doing very badly. You know, most of our country is running very well. Even in terms of crime, most of our country is setting records in terms of low. But when you look at Chicago, when you look at what's going on in Illinois and New York and other places, both economically and in other ways, it's horrible. It's horrible.
 The President. Look at Oregon. Look what's going on in Oregon. They have—I don't think they have a clue. We could stop that—if they would request it, we would stop that problem in 1 hour, like we did in Minneapolis. We would stop it in 1 hour. It would be over. It's so easy to do.
 All right, please, go ahead. In the back, please.
 Israel-United Arab Emirates Relations/Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./Iran 
 Israel-United Arab Emirates Relations/Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./Iran  Q. Alicia Powe at the Gateway Pundit. Yesterday you announced a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. And later in the day, Joe Biden tried to take credit for it.
 Q.  The President. I heard that. That was a beauty. That's right.
 The President. Q. What's your response?
 Q.  The President. We announced the deal. And I appreciate even the New York Times gave it great coverage and editorials today. Wall Street Journal, Washington Post—everybody was saying great. And this is something we've been working very hard on.
 The President. And I saw where Sleepy Joe tried to claim credit for it, and I'm trying to figure out how that one works. No, what he did is, they made a terrible deal with Iran. And the deal was a horror show, and I ended it. They gave them $150 billion for nothing. They gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. They got nothing from that deal except trouble. They did nothing. They—just like they've been weak on China, they've been weak on Russia. They've been weak on everyone. And they were the weakest of all on Iran.
 No, that was a great deal made by very talented people that work with me. And it's been praised all over the world. And what you'll see now is, other countries will come into that deal, and you'll have peace in the Middle East. And Biden doesn't even know—he doesn't even know the name of the countries I'm talking about.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. The President. Thank you very much, everybody. We'll see you. Thank you. The President.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1254"
"22","The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey","
          Aug 15, 2020        ","The President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And thank you for being here. Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.
 The President. Nearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that's despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world. We're up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country. This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July. That's a big reduction. The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.
 And I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation. We know that. And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job.
 The United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined. If you combine all of Europe, it's less than what we do. Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes. Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within 3 days. So we've gotten that number down from about 8 days to 3 days, and that's only in the longer-term lab cases. But we have many 15-minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests. The turnaround time for Federal surge testing sites is just 2 days. So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can't do anything about, it's all the way down to 2 days. That's a very substantial reduction. Great job by the people that do it.
 We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals. Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, but account for nearly half of all fatalities. That's an incredible thing. So it's 1 percent of the U.S. population, but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus. That's why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment. And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.
 In the coming days, we've worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the Governors—50 Governors all around the United States—and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the Governors. And I think, for the most part, they're doing a really good job. They're focused very heavily on nursing homes. And when they need equipment that they can't get—remember, they're supposed to get it, but when they can't get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.
 Thanks to my administration's decisive action to save American jobs, we're currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. And that's because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore—the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we're recovering much faster than anybody anticipated. It turns out that it will be a very, very strong ""V,"" and you'll see that in just a second.
 So retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an alltime high. That's not alltime for this month or last month; that's at an alltime high, and you see that with the chart. This was previous to the plague, I call it—the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188—dealing with 188 countries. And if you see, we've not only recovered, but we're at a much higher level than we were even then. That's an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible. So we're currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. That's an amazing statement.
 So retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up—auto production has surged 28 percent, and that's your auto production, which is right there.
 [At this point, the President displayed a chart.]
 At this point, the President displayed a chart. So you'll see that that's now about even to where it was, and that was at an alltime record high, and we're already even.
 And if you had a chart for used cars, you'd see that used car sales are setting a record, and that's great for production because when the used cars are practically not available—they're very, very tight—that means you're going to make a lot of new cars. So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that's a fantastic number. That's a number that's the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.
 So you see what's happening with respect to the economy and the recovery. And the stock market is almost at an alltime high. In fact, NASDAQ is at an alltime high. It's had 14 days where we broke the record already over the last 2 months. So a lot of great things are happening.
 Through the historic relief package that I signed into law, we saved over 50 million American jobs—50 million American jobs—and the unemployment rate is rapidly going down. You see that. You've seen that. And I think you'll see it over the next 2 months, and you'll have a good report even prior to the election. You're going to have a very good report. I think you're going to have an incredible GDP. You're going to have a tremendous report on business, and a lot of it's going to be released, which is very fortunate, prior to the election.
 I think the Democrats are going out of their way to try and do whatever they can to stop these kind of numbers. They don't like these kind of numbers, because they think it'll hurt them in the election. I think we all have to pull together and we have to do the right job, and we have to do what's good for the American people.
 We were unfairly treated by China, because they could have stopped it. With that being said, China has purchased the most amount of corn in history. They—last week, they purchased the 2 largest days in the history of corn purchase and a massive amount of soybeans. Also cattle.
 So China has been buying a lot of things, and they are doing that to keep me happy, but they're dreaming about Joe Biden. They would love to have that happen, but I don't think that's going to happen. They are dreaming about him and so is Iran—dreaming about Joe—and so are numerous other countries. They dream about it because if that happens, they'll own the United States. And China, I can tell you, specifically, will own the United States. Can't let that happen.
 If you remember, China had the worst year they've had in 67 years prior to the plague coming to our shores. And we are now starting to do really well. We're going to have a very good third quarter, maybe a great third quarter. And we're going to have an incredible next year, unless somebody comes up and quadruples taxes, which is what they're talking about doing.
 And also, regulations we've set—we've done more in terms of cutting regulations than any administration in history by far, whether it was 4 years or 8 years or, in one case, more than 8 years. We have, in less than 4 years, done more regulation cutting by far. And we're doing more as we go. Some of it is statutory; you can only do it at a certain pace. You have to wait 90 days, you have to wait 120 days before you can take the next step. We have tremendous regulation cutting coming. With that being said, we're going to have certain regulations to protect the environment and also safety. Small business optimism has come surging back. In June, it was higher than any month under the previous administration. Think of that. So small business optimism was higher than any month under the previous administration. And that is while we're going through a pandemic, a worldwide pandemic, you have a number like that. And when you see the numbers that we quoted just now as to what's happening with cases and all of the other hospitalization rates, a lot of tremendous things are happening.
 Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate ever recorded. I mean, think of these numbers. I mean, how does that happen? Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate on record, which is ""ever recorded.""
 Consumer spending is expected to grow at an astronomical rate this quarter. So we don't have the number yet, but it looks like it's going to be at an astronomical rate.
 I want to say that I want college football to come back. These are strong, healthy, incredible people. These are people that want to play football very badly. A great, great talent at quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, called me on—2 days ago. I spoke to him a couple of times. And he said, ""Sir, I want to just tell you we want it back, we want to play."" And he's an incredible quarterback, as you know, from an incredible school, Clemson. And he's going to have a very good future in the NFL. He's got everything. He's got height, accuracy, a strong arm, and he's fast. Other than that, I guess he's got some problems. [Laughter] But he's got the whole package. I watched him last year running. He was faster than the backs that were guarding. I think he's going to be great.
 Laughter But he's just a great young man. I talked to him actually for a long time. They want to play football. And he made the statement that he feels he's safer on the field. He's safer on the field than he is out—you know, outside of the field. He feels very safe.
 And if you look, the SEC, the Big 12, and the ACC are back. They want to come back, and I think they're coming back. The Big 10, the Pac 12, are not, and I wish they would come back.
 And, you know, I just want to say it's sort of sad, because I've been fighting for football to come back. We're trying to help the NFL, as long as they stand for our National Anthem, as long as they honor our flag and our country. If they start kneeling, I'm not going to be helping them much. They might come back, but I won't be watching. Neither will a lot of other people.
 I think what the NBA did was atrocious. I thought it was disgraceful the way they kneeled. And their ratings are reflective of that. But I think football has to get smart. That's the NFL; let's see what happens. But if they do it—they learned their lesson, I thought, 2 years ago, when people started not watching and when people really weren't going to the game so much. A lot of empty seats all of a sudden. So they're going to learn that lesson again if they don't wise up.
 But I just want to say—so, Trevor Lawrence, great. And some of the great people—SEC, Big 12, ACC—I want to thank them, and I want to congratulate them for coming back.
 I want to also mention that CNN had a story that, ""Will they blame Trump for football in the swing States?"" What a dishonest story that is. Will they blame me? I'm the one that's pushing them to come back. So they want to try and blame me. So them and, I guess, the New York Times reported one person—it was one person in the story—one person said maybe it's Trump's fault. And I'm the one pushing them back.
 So I'd like to see college football come back. I'd like to see them come back proud and strong. I was very impressed by Trevor. I was very impressed by other people that called me. Players called me, coaches called me—Coach O. If you want a coach who's central casting for a movie—if you're doing a movie, you have to put Coach O as the head, because this guy is central casting. But when you have guys like Nick Saban and others calling for it to come back—they want it to come back. And these are great athletes. These are not people that seem to be at all susceptible to this horrible disease. And they want to play football. And we have great testing, so you'll be able to test.
 And when CNN and the New York Times—the New York Times quoted one person—one person. And I'm the one pushing. So we'll get it straight: I'm the one pushing for football to come back. I think if I wasn't pushing, you wouldn't have anything happening.
 So, with that, we'll take—we'll take a few questions. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please.
 Iran/U.S. Seizure of Iranian Oil Tankers/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 Iran/U.S. Seizure of Iranian Oil Tankers/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, thank you. The U.S. effort to extend the Iran arms embargo at the U.N. Security Council——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——fell apart yesterday. When will you trigger a snapback of sanctions on Iran?
 Q.  The President. Well, we knew what the vote was going to be, but we'll be doing a snapback. You'll be watching it next week.
 The President. Q. Will it be soon?
 Q.  The President. Yes, you'll be watching it next week.
 The President. Q. And if I could follow up: President Putin wants to hold a video summit——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——on this subject.
 Q.  The President. He has asked.
 The President. Q. Are you wanting to do that? Will you participate?
 Q.  The President. Probably not. No, I think we want to wait until after the election. Look, Iran wants me to lose so badly, because if they do—you know, Iran is a whole different ballgame right now. They haven't been sponsoring terror because they don't have very much money to sponsor terror, and they know we just captured four Iranian ships, as you know, and we brought them into Houston. They were going to Venezuela; they're not supposed to be doing that. Iran would love to have me defeated.
 The President. If I win, which I hope to win—how can you not when you see numbers like this, both on the virus and on the economy? I mean, we should win. We should all be—keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I'll build it again. I've already—I think the hardest part is done in terms of the economy. And that's with or without additional funds from Nancy Pelosi. They should have put the things in—whether you call it the CARE Act or phase one, phase two, phase three—but they didn't do that. You know, they put it at the end, things that they're asking for that have nothing to do with corona, that have everything to do with radical-left politics.
 U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, more than 40 States have received letters from your Postal Service saying that the ballots for November 3 might not make it in time.
 Q.  The President. Well, we'll see.
 The President. Q. As President, isn't it your responsibility, since this is your Postal Service, to meet this critical need?
 Q.  The President. Well, we have a man in there for 2 months. He's a very talented man. He's a brilliant business person. He's done great. He's a very nice man also. And he—Louis—he is working very hard.
 The President. But as you know, the Democrats aren't approving the proper funding for Postal, and they're not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing that they want to do, which is all mail-in voting. Universal, you could call it, mail-in voting.
 Again, absentee voting is great. You request—I'm an absentee voter because I requested, I got, and then I sent in my vote. So that works out very well. That's what we've had. But now they want to send in millions and millions of ballots. And you see what's happening. They're being lost, they're being discarded. They're finding them in piles. It's going to be a catastrophe. So—and this is beyond the Post Office.
 But Louis DeJoy is working very hard. The Post Office has, for decades, lost billions and billions of dollars. I read numbers today that are unthinkable. And what they want to do now is hit the Post Office with millions of ballots from certain States. And if you look at what happened in New York and Virginia and various other places, it's a catastrophe. They're losing 20 percent of the votes. Nobody knows what's happened.
 So we're going to see what happens. But I do say this: Universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic. It's going to make our country a laughingstock all over the world. You can't send out millions of ballots.
 And look at all of the tests. Look, you've seen them, and there are many. Far more—just look at New York. Look at New Jersey. Look at the catastrophe in New Jersey. And New Jersey had more than just Paterson. Look at what's going on in Virginia. Look at what's happening with this mail-in voting. It's a disgrace. Absentee is good; mail-in, universal, is very, very bad. There's no way they're going to get it accurately. They're off by 20 and 30 percent. And this is beyond Post Office.
 Now, with that being said, they want money for the universal mail-in ballots, and they're not getting it. You know why? Because of them. We want money to go to people. They want money in order to bail out States that have done very poorly. The States that have done poorly, you know them as well as I do, these are run by Democrats, usually radical-left Democrats.
 You take a look at what's happening in Portland. And we'll go into Portland—we have to be asked—we'll go into Portland, straighten it out in 1 hour, like happened in Minneapolis. We'll go straighten it out in 1 hour. We will straighten that out so fast, but they have to ask us.
 So they need money, but they're not willing to approve the money that they need. If they can't get the money that they need for universal mail-in voting, I don't see how they can have it. And that's not only Post Office, it's also for the voting itself.
 U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies 
 U.S. Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies  Q. A follow on that, Mr. President. Does Postmaster DeJoy have your backing for the actions that he's taken in the last several days?
 Q.  The President. Yes. He's a fantastic man.
 The President. Q. Does that include removing——
 Q.  The President. He wants to make the Post Office great again. Do you ever hear the expression? He wants to make the Post Office great again.
 The President. Q. So you support removing 10 percent of——
 Q.  The President. The Post Office is a catastrophe.
 The President. Q. ——mail-sorting machines nationwide? That's one of the things that he's [inaudible].
 Q.  inaudible The President. I don't know what he's doing. I can only tell you he's a very smart man. He'll be a great Postmaster General. And he needs—obviously, if you're going to do these millions of ballots out of nowhere, he's going to obviously need funding. But the Democrats aren't willing to provide other things and therefore they're not going to get the funding for that.
 The President. But you are going to have a catastrophic situation with universal mail-in votes. And, on top of it, the Democrats aren't willing to give the people the money and the Post Office the money.
 Vote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election/U.S. Postal Service 
 Vote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election/U.S. Postal Service  Q. Mr. President, you said a catastrophic situation is going to happen, but what are you doing to ensure that that doesn't happen, because wouldn't these problems raise questions about the election results if you win?
 Q.  The President. Well, the problem with the mail-in voting, number one, you're never going to know when the election is over. Okay? I mean, they called the election in New York for Carolyn Maloney. They shouldn't have done that. I think you should redo that election. And, you know, the opponent is screaming. They can't believe it. Ballots are lost. Ballots are defrauded. It's a total mess. And they called it for her. The reason is because I've been using it as a case. I've been using it as a case. So, look——
 The President. Q. But Mr. President——
 Q. The President. We are going to have an election that takes place on a beautiful day, November 3. And usually, at the end of the evening, they say, ""Donald Trump has won the election."" ""Donald Trump is your new President."" Whatever they say.
 The President. You know what? You're not going to know this—possibly, if you really did it right—for months or for years, because these ballots are all going to be lost. They're going to be gone. And just take a look on a smaller basis—but it's great tests. We're doing tests. I mean, these are—you could call them polls, you could call them tests. Look at what's happening all over the country, where you have universal mail-in——
 Q. But what are you doing——
 Q.  The President. Wait a minute. The ballots are lost. There's fraud. There's theft. It's happening all over the place.
 The President. Now, we're going to do it with this whole, vast, big section of the country. It's crazy.
 Q. Have you, because you have made it so plain that you are opposed and do not trust mail-in voting, is your Postmaster General using the agency of the Postal Service to create delays because——
 Q.  The President. No, not at all. He would love to see it happen. I didn't speak to him about it, but I will tell you this: I would imagine he would say number one, they didn't give me the funding for it, because it's sitting in Congress, because they want a trillion dollars to bail out States, just so you——
 The President. Q. But this isn't what is causing delays, sir.
 Q.  The President. ——understand what they want.
 The President.  Q. Yes, sir.
 Q.  The President. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run Democrat-run States, okay? That's what they want. They're not giving the money to the Post Office. They have to give the money to the Post Office.
 The President. Q. But the steps the Postmaster General is taking are creating some delays now.
 Q.  The President. No, the steps he's creating——
 The President. Q. Is he trying to——
 Q.  The President. Yes. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——discourage mail-in voting? Are you trying to discourage?
 Q.  The President. No, not at all. The steps that he is taking are trying to stop the tremendous losses that have taken place for many, many years. He's trying to streamline the Post Office and make it great again. Okay?
 The President. Q. Eighty days before an election, sir? Is this the right time?
 Q.  The President. Well, wait a minute. You just threw—look, I just read last night that now New Jersey is going to try the universal mail-in voting. Well, they didn't know this. So now, all of a sudden, New Jersey is going to be hit with millions of ballots to be sent out. They didn't know anything about this.
 The President. So how does a Post Office—how does a Postal Service that doesn't know about it, now all of a sudden, New Jersey is supposed to take out, and millions of ballots are going to be sent all over New Jersey?
 And if you look at some of the things they say, like in—take the State of Nevada, take that little scam that's going on over there with the clubhouse politician Governor. Take that, where the votes don't even have to be in until 7—they get counted 7 days after November 3. That means if—Nevada is a very important State. I think we have a great chance of winning that State. If the votes don't have to be in for 7—and they're not counting the votes—7 days later, that means how are they going to predict a winner on November 3?
 Q. Mr. President, the inspector general announced that they are——
 Q.  U.S. Postal Service/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 U.S. Postal Service/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, whether a ballot was automatically sent to somebody or if it was requested——
 Q.  The President. No, absentee is okay.
 The President. Q. Okay, but once a ballot gets into the mail, it doesn't matter—the workers have to sort it. So the bottom line is, there must be more resources for post offices across the country to deal with——
 Q.  The President. But the Democrats are not—they are not approving the resources. You're right, there has to be more resources, I agree, because all of a sudden——
 The President. Q. So are you doing anything to provide that?
 Q.  The President. ——the Post Office is tripling up instead.
 The President.  The problem is the Democrats are not approving the funds necessary. It's in there. Now, they have $25 billion. I've seen $15 billion. I've seen a lot of money. I don't know how you're going to spend that much, but that's what they're saying. They're saying. So not only do they want a trillion dollars to hand out as welfare to all these States that are run by Democrats doing badly, they want $25 billion for the Post Office. But they're not approving it.
 Now, what I want is a lot of money—thousands of dollars—to go to people because they need money. They really—despite the good numbers, despite numbers like that, they need money to live. And I want that to happen. The Democrats don't care about that. They just want to give bailout money to their friends running big States poorly.
 Q. A question on vaccines.
 Q.  Q. Mr. President, should you be looking in the camera, sir, and ensuring the United States, the people of the United States, that mailing——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead.
 The President. Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward J. Snowden 
 Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward J. Snowden  Q. Do you want to give Edward Snowden a pardon and bring him back? You once suggested that he was a traitor and should be executed.
 Q.  The President. Well, I'm going to look at it. I mean, I'm not that aware of the Snowden situation, but I'm going to start looking at it. There are many, many people—it seems to be a split decision that many people think that he should be somehow treated differently, and other people think he did very bad things. And I'm going to take a very good look at it. Okay?
 The President. I mean, I've seen people that are very conservative and very liberal, and they agree on the same issue; they agree both ways. I'm going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden.
 Yes, please.
 Coronavirus Prevalence and Mortality Rates/Protective Face Masks/Economic Recovery Efforts 
 Coronavirus Prevalence and Mortality Rates/Protective Face Masks/Economic Recovery Efforts  Q. Do you believe with Dr. Robert Redfield who, earlier this week, said if America doesn't follow public health guidelines, we could be in store for one of the worst falls we've ever faced, from a public health perspective?
 Q.  The President. No, I mean, you can't compare it to 1917. That was incredible. That was—that was the worst ever by far. That was—you look at—they lost possibly 100 million people. No, I don't agree with that.
 The President. But if you look at these numbers, they're coming down very substantially. And I do believe that Americans—many are wearing masks, which is a good thing. Again, some people thought that you shouldn't wear a mask. You know, when this whole thing started, Dr. Fauci, who I like and respect, said ""don't wear masks,"" okay? And so did Dr. Redfield. And then, all of a sudden, it was like everybody should wear masks. And that's okay. People can change their mind.
 But wash your hands, good hygiene—all of those things—I think people are really doing it to a level that they've never done before.
 And when you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it's very impressive when you see what's happening.
 By the way, Florida doing well. You see that. And hospitalizations and all—you know, normally you would have had to build more—like we did for the first surge. We've done it right. We closed it up. We had the greatest economy in history. We closed it up. We understand the disease now. Nobody knew. Nobody knew what was hitting us, right? Nobody knew that old people would be very, very susceptible, especially if they have heart and diabetes problems and other problems; that old people would be very susceptible and young people would be extremely good with it. If you look at the percentages, there are a tiny percentage that have problems, especially the big problem.
 So, no, I think that we're doing very well. We're on our way. And we're also opening up our economy, and our economy is going to set records. And if stupid people aren't elected next year, we're going to have one of the greatest years that we've ever had.
 Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], go ahead, please.
 Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd. 
 Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You've already taken action on TikTok and WeChat.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. Which other Chinese tech companies are you looking at banning from operating in the United States?
 Q.  The President. Well, the big thing is Huawei, right? Huawei is not here. And Huawei, I'm not allowing. And I've told European countries and others—Australia has been fantastic, as an example. But Huawei is not coming here.
 The President. And we told certain countries that were thinking about Huawei: ""That's okay, you can use them, but we're not going to be sharing intelligence."" And they've all backed away. You look at the U.K., it looked like they were going that way, and now they backed out—Scotland Yard.
 Q. Are there other particular companies—say, Alibaba?
 Q.  The President. There are most—well, yes.
 The President. Q. Baidu.
 Q.  The President. We're looking at other things. Yes, we are. We are.
 The President. U.S. Postal Service 
 U.S. Postal Service  Q. Mr. President, you say that you want the mail to be processed as quickly as it can, but why is your Postal Service dismantling these mail-sorting machines across the country at this time?
 Q.  The President. Well, you'll have to ask him. I know this: He's a very efficient operator, a very good operator, but again, he needs money to operate if you're going to hit him with millions of ballots.
 The President. Q. Did he brief you on his plans?
 Q.  The President. And if you ask him, he will tell you, and he'll tell you very nicely: You have the money, it's sitting there, it's ready to go. The Democrats don't want to approve it, but I want money for other things too. I want money to go to people so they can live very nicely, because China caused the problem; they didn't.
 The President. Go ahead.
 Senator Kamala D. Harris 
 Senator Kamala D. Harris  Q. On the campaign: Will you say now that Kamala Harris is eligible to run and be Vice President or President, based on being born in Oakland, California?
 Q.  The President. So, I have nothing to do with that. I read something about it. And I will say that he is a brilliant lawyer that—I guess he wrote an article about it. So I know nothing about it, but it's not something that bothers me.
 The President. Q. But, sir, when you do that, it creates doubt.
 Q.  The President. Why do you say that? I just don't know about it, but it's not something that we will be pursuing.
 The President. Q. But you do know it, sir. You do——
 Q.  The President. Let me put it differently.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, you know.
 Q.  The President. Let me be——
 The President. Q. You can simply clear this up.
 Q.  The President. Let me put it differently. Don't tell me what I know. [Laughter] Let me put it differently. Let me put it differently: To me, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem. It's not something that I'm going to be pursuing.
 The President. Laughter Q. Is she eligible, sir?
 Q.  The President. I just told you, I have not gone into it in great detail. If she's got a problem, you would have thought that she would——
 The President. Q. It's not that hard, sir.
 Q.  The President. ——have been vetted.
 The President.  Q. It's not that hard.
 Q.  The President. You would have thought that she would have been vetted by Sleepy Joe.
 The President. Yes, go ahead.
 Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. President, sir, I just want to ask you: After 3 weeks of absolutely no deal, you have been ragging on Democrats constantly. Why not come to the table, personally, and sit with them? I mean, I know that Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer were in the Oval Office in December 2018. That did not go so well. Everybody in the world saw that. Why not invite them? If they don't want to come, that's on them.
 Q.  The President. So I think we've done very well. We've had three phases. We're into phase four. We've gotten everything we wanted. And we've also gotten a great economy. All you have to do is take a look at these charts. Our economy is doing good. But we want different things than them. I want money for the people; they want money to bail out Democrat Governors and Democrat mayors.
 The President. Q. But shouldn't you, as the President, meet with them in person?
 Q.  The President. Listen to me. Listen to me. My people are doing very good. And my people call me. They're in the office; they call me. They call me. When it's right—nobody knows the deal better than I do. When it's right, I'll meet. But right now it's not right. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run States—they're Democrat. They're all—I mean, they're Democrat States. Will something happen? Possibly. But I want to tell you, the country is doing very well right now. We can live very happily with it, without it. But I'd like to do it, because I want to give money to the people. I want to put money into the people's hands. They want to put money into politicians' hands so that the politicians don't look stupid.
 The President. Okay. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please?
 Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper 
 Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper  Q. You've had some differences with your Defense Secretary, Mark Esper. Do you have confidence in his leadership there?
 Q.  The President. Mark ""Yesper""? Did you call him ""Yesper""?
 The President. Q. Esper.
 Q.  The President. Oh, okay. Some people call him ""Yesper."" No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine. He's fine.
 The President. Q. Okay.
 Q.  The President. Yes. No problem.
 The President. Q. Are you considering firing him, Mr. President?
 Q.  The President. I consider firing everybody. [Laughter] At some point, that's what happens.
 The President. Laughter Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], do you have something, Jennifer? You're working so hard.
 2020 Presidential Election/The President's Cabinet 
 2020 Presidential Election/The President's Cabinet  Q. Do you think that there will be anyone else who leaves your Cabinet after the election, sir?
 Q.  The President. So, if we have the success—I think we have a silent majority, the likes of which has never been seen before—I think you read about it—where 62 percent of the people say they're not even telling the truth on polling and where the polling is fake; you know, where they do registered voters and where they do many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Same as happened last time.
 The President. But this year, I think we have much more enthusiasm. Maybe those people back there would understand it better than anybody. But I think there's more enthusiasm for 2020 than there was even for 2016. And 2016 was a record. You found that out. And I believe there's much more enthusiasm now than there was even in 2016.
 We have a silent majority, the likes of which nobody has seen. I just looked—there are thousands of boats in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Thousands and thousands of boats. It's called ""Boaters for Trump,"" ""Boaters for Trump-Pence."" There's signs all over. Some of the boats have 10 flags on them. They're incredible. There are thousands. We did nothing to do this. This is just generic. It just happened.
 Let me just tell you, I think the level of enthusiasm for what we're doing—we want law and order. We want low taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to get rid of—they want to have open borders. And they want to defund the police. How do you win on that? They want to go to Texas, and they want to go to Pennsylvania, and they want to stop fracking. And Ohio, they want to stop fracking. They're against steel, they're against anything with petroleum, the word petroleum in it. You won't have a country. These people are crazy.
 Q. But as far as your Cabinet?
 Q.  The President. Say it? Go ahead.
 The President. Q. As far as your Cabinet goes, do you think you'll see more turnover in your Cabinet?
 Q.  The President. Well, I don't know. I think for next year—I mean, generally speaking, a lot of times I understand when, if we win, a President will ask for the resignation of everybody and then bring back the people he wants. That's happened before, Steve. And I could see something like that happening. I think that makes sense.
 The President. No, I have a very good Cabinet—I mean, with few exception. I wouldn't say I'm thrilled with everybody, frankly. [Laughter]. But I have—overall, I think we have a very good Cabinet.
 Laughter Q. Sir, could you——
 Q. The President. I think this—I will say this: No administration—none—no administration, first 3½ years, has done anywhere near what we've done. Three hundred—we will have, at the end of the first term, 300, maybe more, Federal judges including Court of Appeals, two Supreme Court Justices. Nobody has done this.
 The President. Take a look at—take a look at what we've done: the biggest tax cuts in history; the biggest regulation cuts in history; rebuilt our military; took care of our vets. We have a 91 percent approval rating from the vets. Nobody has ever had a 91 percent approval rating before. We—I guarded the Second Amendment. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. Take a look at Kamala. They want to destroy the Second Amendment.
 And, as you know, Joe is—has no control over anybody. He has no control over himself.
 Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey-1"
"23","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 19, 2020        ","The President.  Well, thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I'd like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
 The President.  Today I'm directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It's a snapback, not uncommon.
 Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran—$150 billion, to be exact—plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don't know that the President had the authority to give; gave $1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster, that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
 And I won't say anything, because I don't like saying it, but Iran doesn't have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorists, to give to Al Qaida and various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together, and it's not easy for them.
 And if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.
 But that deal was a disaster: $150 billion; $1.8 billion in cash. And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal. A short-term, expiring. It's starting to expire already. It's terminated, but it would have, if we didn't terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
 A good deal was the deal we made with U.A.E. and Israel. And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal, countries that you wouldn't even believe want to come into that deal. And, all of a sudden, you're going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn't have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.
 I imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations. And if they do, they'll have hell to pay.
 Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world's number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS. Nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated—we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was—they were all over the place.
 My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have—mark it down. Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East. Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities. It's absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles—Democrat-run cities—they're a mess because they don't get it. Either they don't get it or there's something that nobody else understands.
 We've deployed more than 1,000 additional Federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand. And we can stop it immediately, like at Portland would be so easy to stop. We'd stop it immediately.
 We only sent in some Homeland people—who are great, by the way—to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it's Homeland, whether it's FBI, whether it's just law enforcement—and we'd send them in quickly. We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis. As soon as they were called in—they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would have had far less damage.
 Today we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow. And they'll be a very long time in prison for what they've done to these cities. Most cities are well run; most of the Nation is well run. And the areas that we're talking about are all—in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.
 We've made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.
 We're also using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat, as you know, the China virus. New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week. Eighty percent. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak. And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look—because we've done an incredible job—but they're having a lot of outbreaks, but they'll be able to put them out, and we put them out.
 The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country, 54 percent since its peak in April. Fifty-four percent. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years—think of that—44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems—heart, diabetes, and other problems, but—many of those. So think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.
 Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States, evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea—you've been reading about South Korea doing well. Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they'll be able to solve the problem.
 We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing: There's nothing like campus, there's nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It's been proven a lot better. It's a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you're not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few—a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don't talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn't. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.
 Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense.
 And the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that—in all cases, Democrat run—still shut down, and the numbers there aren't even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse. A lot of problems are being caused—probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.
 Colleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.
 The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings—and to prevent transmission, period, but especially in nursing homes—and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
 We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It's something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.
 In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high-risk, while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting open quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.
 And I want to thank you all for being here, and we'll take some questions.
 Yes, please.
 QAnon Conspiracy Theory/Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities 
 QAnon Conspiracy Theory/Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities  Q. During the pandemic, the QAnon movement has been—appears to be gaining a lot of followers. Can you talk about what you think about that and what you have to say to people who are following this movement right now?
 Q.  The President. Well, I don't know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate, but I don't know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I hear, it's—these are people that, when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City in just the last 6 or 7 months—but this was starting even 4 years ago when I came here. Almost 4 years; can you believe it? These are people that don't like seeing what's going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and States. And I've heard these are people that love our country, and they just don't like seeing it.
 The President. So I don't know, really, anything about it other than they do, supposedly, like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas—like, especially the areas that we're talking about—go away. Because there's no reason the Democrats can't run a city. And if they can't, we will send in all of the Federal—whether it's troops or law enforcement, whatever they'd like—we'll send them in. We'll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less. Okay?
 Q. And, Mr. President, at the crux of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are behind or a believer in?
 Q.  The President. Well, I haven't heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it. I'm willing to put myself out there.
 The President. And we are, actually. We're saving the world from a radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That's the importance of this country.
 And when you look at some of the things that these people are saying, with ""defund the police"" and no borders, open borders—everybody just pour right into our country; no testing, no nothing. You know, you talk about testing—no testing. Mexico, as you know, has a very high rate of infection.
 The wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long. Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. Had that—and this is through luck, perhaps, more than talent, although the talent is getting built when one party refuses to allow it. You don't hear talk about the wall anymore.
 But I will say this: We need strength in our country, not weakness. Too much weakness.
 Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Please.
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. Mr. President, you have been very bullish on the promise of convalescent plasma——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——to treat coronavirus. The FDA appeared to be on the brink of issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma. But after hearing from top officials at the NIH that there wasn't enough evidence to go ahead with that, the FDA has put that on pause. Your reaction to that? And do you believe that convalescent plasma should be in the arsenal of treatments for coronavirus?
 Q.  The President. Well, I hear great things about it, John. That's all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision, because you have a lot of people over there that don't want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3. And you've heard that one before.
 The President. But I've heard fantastic things about convalescent plasma. And I've heard numbers way over 50-percent success. And people are dying, and we should have it approved if it's good. And I'm hearing it's good. I heard from people at the FDA that it's good. So we'll see. I'm going to check that right after this conference.
 Q. It's my understanding that the White House will encourage the NIH and the FDA to get this out there as quickly as possible. Is that correct?
 Q.  The President. Well, if the numbers are as good as I'm hearing—I mean, I'm hearing over 50 percent, and that's very good. And we've approved—certain things are at 31 percent, and that's okay, too; that's not bad. And it's really had a tremendous impact.
 The President. But, no, I have—you're telling me something right now that surprises me, but we'll check it out right after this.
 Q. Are you concerned about a delay?
 Q.  The President. I don't want delays. I don't want people dying. I don't want people dying.
 The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company 
 Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company  Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you about your tweet earlier today on Goodyear. It was essentially calling for a boycott on Goodyear tires.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. Do you want the Federal Government to stop buying and using Goodyear product as well? And is there anything——
 Q.  The President. Well, I'm not happy with Goodyear, because what they're doing is playing politics. And the funny thing is, the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you I poll very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear.
 The President. And when they say that you can't have ""Blue Lives Matter,"" you can't show a blue line, you can't wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there's something wrong with the top of Goodyear.
 And what the radical left does is, they make it impossible for people to do business if they're Republican or if they're conservative. They put out all sorts of effort: ""Don't shop there."" They do vicious things, not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland 2 nights ago.
 Q. But what kind of boycott do you envision?
 Q.  The President. Oh, I don't know. That's up to people. But I wouldn't recommend it. If they want to hold political speech, if they want to let you not do what everybody is doing; if they want to wear a MAGA hat or if they want to wear a ""Blue Lives""—you know what ""Blue Lives Matter,"" right? That's police men and women. That's a terrible thing. That's a terrible thing.
 The President. So they're using their power over these people, and these people want to wear whatever it is that we're talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor if people don't want to buy there. And you know what? They'll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter, as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You'll be able to get another good jobs. I think it's disgraceful that they did this.
 Please, go ahead, in the back.
 Next Digital Ltd. Founder Jimmy Lai/Hong Kong 
 Next Digital Ltd. Founder Jimmy Lai/Hong Kong  Q. Yes. Mr. President, you've said that the arrest of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong is, quote, ""a terrible thing."" Do you have a message for Jimmy Lai? Has your administration spoken directly with him? Is your State Department working for his release?
 Q.  The President. Well, I send him best wishes. I hear he's a wonderful gentleman. He's certainly a brave man. And I send him best wishes.
 The President. With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we've taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong. We essentially subsidized Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives. And that's what made Hong Kong—the exchange and business in Hong Kong—successful. I've taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business. You know, we really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom.
 But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions and billions of dollars. And all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. And it'll all come here.
 But I feel badly for him because I hear he's a good person. I don't know him, but I hear he's a good person; obviously, a very brave person.
 Did you have something? Go ahead, please.
 Iraq/Drawdown of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Syria/Turkey/U.S. Military Strength 
 Iraq/Drawdown of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Syria/Turkey/U.S. Military Strength  Q. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. With the Iraqi Prime Minister coming in tomorrow, what about——
 Q.  The President. Say it?
 The President. Q. The Iraqi Prime Minister is coming in tomorrow to meet with you. And how do you feel about this notion that Iraq can once again become the buffer between Iranian influence and Russian influence in the Middle East? Do you feel that under this Prime Minister that that's possible once again? What are your thoughts on it?
 Q.  The President. Well, this is a man that I get along with very well. We're largely out of Iraq. We're down to a very few soldiers. I said we're getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous, endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there. In the Middle East, we should have never been. But we're getting out rapidly, out of—you know, over the course of 3 years. And getting out—it's very sticky getting out. And some people agree, and many people don't agree, but I think most people very much agree.
 The President. We're doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan. We're getting out. We're down to a much smaller number of people left there. And you know, I greet men and women coming home, and coming home after they've been hit. I've also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in.
 And we've been there 19 years, and we're basically policemen. We're acting as police, as opposed to soldiers. And they're going to have to police their own states, and they've been doing that for thousands of years. But it's time, after 19 years, that our soldiers come home.
 They've done an incredible job, but you know, they don't—they're not allowed to fight to win. And maybe they shouldn't be, because a lot of the people—it's not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq—again, we're down in Afghanistan; very low numbers. And that'll be taking place.
 And I let them know, ""Do anything, and you'll be hit like you've never hit—be hit—been hit before."" So we're doing very well. Syria, the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey. Right? And everybody said, ""Oh, this is""—that was 2 years ago. It was a long time ago. They said: ""Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible. We're going to leave.""
 Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan. And Syria has been fighting forever. And I say, ""Why are we guarding their border?"" And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out. And guess what? Nothing's happened. They've been fighting like they have been for a thousand years. Okay? Nothing's happened. And nobody mentions that.
 Everybody said, ""This is going to be a disaster."" There's no disaster; nothing's happened. And so we're getting out of the endless wars. And we are building a military, the likes of which the world has never seen: $2½ trillion we have spent. And we, hopefully, don't ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture.
 It's—when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing, we want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don't want to see that; we don't want to ever use it. We've rebuilt our military: new missiles and new rockets and new tanks and new everything. New everything—$2½ trillion—all made in the U.S.A.
 And we've upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability. And some of our nuclear needed nourishment. It needed new strength. And we've upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean, to a level that nobody would even believe. And hopefully, we don't—you pray to God we never have to use it. Okay? But we've never been in a position where we've been this strong.
 Please.
 Saudi Arabia-Israel Relations/United Arab Emirates Purchase of U.S. Military Equipment/United Arab Emirates-Israel Relations/Iran 
 Saudi Arabia-Israel Relations/United Arab Emirates Purchase of U.S. Military Equipment/United Arab Emirates-Israel Relations/Iran  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. I wanted to ask you about the Middle East. I have a couple questions. You mentioned that other countries are interested in following suit——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——after the Emiratis——
 Q.  The President. Having to do with U.A.E. and Israel.
 The President. Q. Exactly.
 Q.  The President. Correct.
 The President. Q. So is—do you expect that Saudi Arabia will join? And——
 Q.  The President. I do.
 The President. Q. Yes. And also, the Emiratis have expressed interest in the F-35. Do you think that that should be something that they could look forward to in the future? Is there some sort of time delay?
 Q.  The President. No, I think they'll—I think—look, they've definitely got the money to pay for it. You know, it's nice because usually when we—a lot of times, we make deals; they don't have 10 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, ""How about paying this back later?"" But they never pay because they don't have the money.
 The President. No, they have the money, and they would like to order quite a few F-35s; it's the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by far. Stealth. Totally stealth. You can't see it. Makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot: ""What do you think is better, this one? This one? That one?"" Talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes. He said, ""Well, the advantage we have is you can't see it."" So when we're fighting, they can't see us. I say, ""That sounds like a really big advantage to me."" To these guys——
 Q. But the Israelis don't want them to have it.
 Q.  The President. You know, they look—by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet—they look better than Tom Cruise, and they're definitely tougher. And he's a nice guy. But these people are amazing. And I speak to them a lot about it—""What do you think?""—you know, as I go around to the various places. I saved the big one in Florida, as an example. That was a big one. Knocked down, pretty much, by the hurricane. So I spent a lot of time on that. And it's the greatest plane in the world. One thing about that kind of thing—technology, high-technology—the greatest plane doesn't last long. Somebody comes up with something else, but we're always the one to come up with something else.
 The President. So yes, they'd like to buy F-35s; we'll see what happens. It's under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East. Even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that? Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific. And it is terrific.
 I see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly. And when you have them all in, ultimately, Iran will come in too. There'll be peace in the Middle East. That will be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened.
 And with the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened.
 Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company 
 Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company  Q. The Israelis are still——
 Q.  Q. Can I follow on something, Mr. President? On the Goodyear issue: You ride on Goodyear tires——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——in the Presidential limousine.
 Q.  The President. Correct.
 The President. Q. If there were an alternative, would you want those tires swapped out?
 Q.  The President. Yes, I would do that. I would. I would swap them out, based on what I heard. We'll see what happens. Hey, look, you're going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore, and they'll buy from a competitor, made in the U.S.A. too. Okay?
 The President. Please. Go ahead.
 Former President Barack Obama/National Economy/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
 Former President Barack Obama/National Economy/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. Mr. President, excerpts from Obama's speech that he will—he'll give later at the Democratic Convention show that he will—he says that he hoped that you would take being President more ""seriously"" once you have the job and ""discover . . . reverence for democracy."" And then he said, I quote, ""But he never did."" What is your reaction to that?
 Q.  The President. You know, when I listen to that and then I see the horror that he's left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made. Look what we're doing: We have our great border wall. We have security. We have the U.A.E. deal, which has been universally praised, praised by people that aren't exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don't know why; can't be my personality. But they're not fans. Right?
 The President. And when I look at what we have—now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a President he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible. Slowest growing recovery in the history—I guess, since 1929—on the economy.
 Don't forget, until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we're doing it again. I'm going to have to do it a second time. We're doing it again—hard to believe. We're doing very well. You heard the numbers; they're way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we're producing on the stock markets, we're almost at the level—in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at their highest point prior to the China virus coming in, the plague coming in.
 No, President Obama did not do a good job. And the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn't be here. And probably, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as President.
 Thank you all very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1258"
"24","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 23, 2020        ","The President. Well, thank you very much. And it's good to see you all. Hope you had a great weekend at your convention. And we're going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
 The President. But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I'd like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
 Yesterday I approved a major disaster declaration for California—spoke to Governor Newsom—as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their State. That continues. The Federal Government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We're working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great State representatives and local representatives, and we'll take care of the situation. But we have 26,000 first responders already.
 Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes. As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we've ever seen. My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana 2 days later. This is somewhat unprecedented: the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.
 Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous—and tremendous people.
 We have—FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do so many—they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
 I'm asking all Americans in the storm's path to follow the instructions of your State and local Governments very closely. And I've approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly—very, very quickly.
 And I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I've informed him. And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. So we have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
 On the therapeutics front, this is what I've been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization—and that's such a powerful term: emergency use authorization—for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It's had an incredible rate of success. Today's action will dramatically expand access to this treatment. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA—all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential.
 This is the only possible—and it's only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed—that is everybody working together. We're years ahead of approvals. We would be—if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we'd be 2 years, 3 years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you'll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
 To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we're removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the Federal Government.
 We've provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. It's a tremendous number.
 The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.
 Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
 In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have—who have recovered—and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they've donated—but these are people recovered from the virus—to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.
 And today I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It's been really an incredible—just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this.
 And I'll go over the numbers, but if you look at what's happened and the success that we've had that people don't talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world. You don't hear that.
 The European Union's case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
 And I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words. And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up—and especially over the last few days—in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you'll see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it.
 And maybe I'll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen. Thank you very much, Alex.
 Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.
 Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II. Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19. And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world. In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.
 President Trump is the ""right to try"" President, and he's fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments. Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
 The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course—within 3 days of being diagnosed—with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment. We saw about a 35-percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment, which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.
 I just want to emphasize this point, because I don't want you to gloss over this number. We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35-percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. This is a major advance.
 Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we've added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied. Because of the President's Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.
 Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing, so that if they meet FDA's gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
 Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight. Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.
 We've also provided guidance so health care providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
 So, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they've approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.
 And I'll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that's okay, Mr. President.
 The President. Good. Thank you very much.
 The President. Please, Doctor.
 Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen M. Hahn. Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. It's good to be here today to announce FDA's recent decision. From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers. And I just want to echo the President's thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA. They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
 Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen M. Hahn. So plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection—in this case, COVID-19—and that liquid portion can be extracted. And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it's been given to patients with infectious diseases—for more than 100 years. So there was a really good rationale for why this might work. And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the Federal Government, under President Trump's leadership, and that has gone on for the last 4 months. More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program, and over 70,000 have received treatment. This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA. So a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
 So, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data—not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this. Those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.
 In the optimal treatment—the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35-percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.
 Now, we're waiting for more data. We're going to continue to gather data. But this clearly meets the criteria that we've established for emergency use authorization, and we're very pleased with these results.
 So let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35-percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit. What that means is—and if the data continue to pan out—100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.
 We've seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country. And what this EUA does—EUA—emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
 And again, I want to echo the President's and the Secretary's ask of the American people: If you've recovered from COVID-19, please donate. It could save a life.
 And, Mr. President, thank you again.
 The President. Thank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it.
 The President. Okay, any questions, please? Please, go ahead.
 Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to first ask you about the COVID-19 drugs that are in phase three. Are they going to be available to the American population on—you and I talked previously about this idea of ""right to try.""
 Q.  The President. Right.
 The President. Coronavirus Treatment Development 
 Coronavirus Treatment Development  Q. Can we assure the American people that if it's being studied and it's in phase three, you have that right?
 Q.  The President. You know, that's a great question. And I'm not sure a lot of people have been thinking about ""right to try."" We're all waiting for the final answer. And maybe I could ask Stephen, but I would say that ""right to try"" is exactly—if somebody is virtually terminal—in other words, they're not going to make it—and if we have these incredible therapies and drugs that are happening, Alex, I think it's a very interesting question.
 The President. I congratulate you for that question because I think——
 Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
 Q.  The President. ——we're all waiting for that exact final endpoint.
 The President.  What about that, Stephen? We have all of these great—seemingly great answers that are ready to come out, but because of the process, it takes, though—can we use some of this early, under ""right to try""? Please.
 Commissioner Hahn. So it's a really good question. And of course, it all depends on the clinical circumstances and what a doctor and a patient together decide, with respect to the administration of any agent.
 Commissioner Hahn. But if you think about what happened with convalescent plasma and the expanded-access program, this is exactly what happened. This program—so, we have ongoing clinical trials that are randomized between placebo, or an inactive substance, and the convalescent plasma. While that was going on, we knew that there was great demand from patients and doctors. The expanded-access program is a way of actually doing that, and fits perfectly with what the President just said about allowing people to be able to use something that we have now determined to be very safe.
 The President. I think it was something we have to really consider very strongly.
 The President. Commissioner Hahn. Yes, sir.
 Commissioner Hahn. The President. I think it's fantastic.
 The President.  You should get credit for that.
 Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
 Q.  The President. Thank you. That's very good.
 The President. Q. Mr. President?
 Q.  The President. Please, in the back. OAN, please.
 The President. Coronavirus Treatment Development/Food and Drug Administration 
 Coronavirus Treatment Development/Food and Drug Administration  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Convalescent—convalescent plasma, as a treatment, has been around for, you know, a hundred years. You mentioned Warp—Operation Warp Speed, which enabled this process to move along a lot faster. What into the—what went into the effort for this to be approved for COVID-19? And was that holdup political in nature?
 Q.  The President. Well, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn't mind so much. That's my opinion—a very strong opinion. And that's for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics; this has to do with life and death.
 The President. So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright, and we have got some incredible answers. And we're not going to let them be held up, because every day is lives. And we're not going to let that happen. Okay?
 Very good. Thank you.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Please, go ahead.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, in announcing this today, you said that the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Yet Dr. Hahn just said it was showing ""promising efficacy."" So which of the two is correct? The President. Well, I think I'll let Dr. Hahn answer that question.
 Q.  The President. Commissioner Hahn. So, under our legal authority for emergency use authorization, this is not the same as an approval, but it's an authorization, and allows us to expand the access to this. And our data—we know we're going to continue to collect data. We knew that for all of our emergency use authorizations.
 Commissioner Hahn. So, for example, remdesivir, which approves, approved—or authorized on May 1, we're still collecting data. And we will continue to do that with plasma as well.
 So it's the nuances of the language around the authorization that we use and the legal aspects, too.
 Q. So it's a promising treatment; it's not—you couldn't say it's very effective just yet?
 Q.  Commissioner Hahn. So I would say that a 35—if you're one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it, this is pretty significant for that person and their family.
 Commissioner Hahn. The President. Okay? This is a very big day. It's a day we've been looking forward to. Thank you very much. Great question. Thank you very much.
 The President. Q. Was there pressure on you, Dr. Hahn? Q.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1256"
"25","The President's News Conference","
          Aug 31, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. I'd like to begin by saying we've just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market—Dow—in 36 years. That's very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401(k)s and with the stocks that they have. And that's a tremendous achievement: best in 36 years.
 The President. Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38 percent. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid, point-of-care tests. These tests return the results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We're being focusing—we're focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high-risk populations. So we're going to have the 15-minute, and less, tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point-of-care tests. That's something.
 This evening I am pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials. So that's joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and, hopefully, approval. In the United States, we're doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months. Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.
 I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we're seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, Federal law enforcement is working with State and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists, and bring them to justice. We've just come up with a report that we've arrested a large number of people. It's over 200. And you'll be hearing about that, but they've been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We're doing it very low key, but we're trying to help cities. They are, in all cases, Democrat-run, but we're doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent.
 We'd like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately 1 hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don't know why it's good for him to have a city that's falling apart and that's under siege now for 94 days. But, really, it's been under siege for years, if you know Portland.
 So, to the mayor, I say: Whenever you're ready, let us know. We'll solve your problem of violence. We'll solve your problem of crime. We'll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you'll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.
 The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the Federal Government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters, just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we've seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Biden—Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats; it's Democrat-run cities, and it's a shame, and it can be solved so easy. It can be solved very easily.
 The violence is fueled by dangerous rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our Nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they're very good at doing. We've taken that power away. They're afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They're afraid to be destroyed.
 You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife Kelley. What they went through, but other people went through it too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is, the public is very wise to it. They see what's happening, and they're wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly.
 Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about, the—really, you hear this from people—what they're saying, how they're saying it—the violence, it's terrible. And again, it's Democrat politicians. I don't know that they're spurring it on, or they're afraid to stop it. But in any event, we're there to help. We're there to get things under control.
 What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. And frankly, the mayor—Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser—should have done a better job. She did a very poor job. But at the same time, we had the police, who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess, it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down, and—but got right up, and two others joined them, and they were able to get Rand and Kelley through.
 But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar—not to the extent, in terms of taping. We don't have to the tapes as strong, but some people went through—from what I heard—as bad, or worse.
 The violent rioters share Biden's same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our Nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, he didn't mention the fact, and he didn't mention the far left. He didn't mention the far left, or, from what I saw, I don't believe he mentioned the word ""Antifa."" Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn't mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement.
 He went on, point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn't talk about those on the left. And those on the left are the problem, and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side: They're both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious.
 And until that neutralizes, you're never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals repeating the monstrous lie that these were peaceful protests. They're not peaceful protests. That's anarchy. That's—you look at the agitators, you look at the looters, you look at the rioters—that's not a peaceful protest.
 They keep using the term—it's so nice—""peaceful protest."" And behind the reporter, the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I'll be going tomorrow. And at least, the Governor asked me if I could, we would—I said, ""You've got to get the National Guard."" And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things, and that was about 5 days ago, 6 days ago. And ever since, it's been very good.
 Thirteen members of Biden's campaign staff donated to bail and—rioters—they're getting them out of jail. Looters—they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It's outrageous that they're now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem. And they really want to put it on the backs of the police. I see it. The police are—there's just a war on law enforcement in this country. And without law enforcement, we wouldn't have a country. We have very talented people; they're not allowed to do their job.
 If you give the radical left power, what you're seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they've had such problems.
 To defeat them, we must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting. And that's what we want to do.
 They want to destroy our country. They're going to destroy our suburbs. But I think I've gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration; they were going to be made much worse.
 What we're witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our Nation's schools and universities. Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism. Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn't even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren't mentioned.
 Two words that were taken out were the words ""under God""—""under God""—two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance. In their caucus, I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said: ""That's strange. What's—that's a big""—I tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn't make a mistake. Then, they did it later on.
 So they took the word—essentially, took the word ""God"" out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We're not taking the word ""God"" out of anything. We're not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we're not taking the great word ""God"" out of anything.
 At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left's war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it's good, but it's gotten out of control. They're unable to control this radical-left, crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly—very, very, quickly indeed.
 The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our Nation's schools, where they're trying to change everything that we've learned. What we've learned—in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason—cancel culture—whatever you want to call it.
 At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance—zero—for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the U.S. population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated.
 Biden won't even say the name ""Antifa."" I don't believe he said it today. He made a speech, and he didn't mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn't mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement, he mentioned the police, and—but he didn't mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there's no way that he'll solve the problem. You don't name it, you don't solve it.
 In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants: the far-left policy agenda it's asking for. And if that happened, we don't have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn't go away; they gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.
 Most of our Nation is extremely safe, by the way. You know, you only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago, and you see what's happened in New York just in a very short period of time. It's horrible what's happened in New York. I love New York; I come from New York. And when I see—4 years ago, I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He's terrible mayor; one of the worst. I can't say ""the worst."" I mean, I've witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he's certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what's happening in New York, and I look at what's happening in the city, and—so quickly. It happened so quickly. It's a shame.
 Biden's strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he's doing—I don't think he even knows what he's doing—and give them control over every lever of power in the United States Government. But when you surrender to the mob, you don't get freedom, you get fascism. That's what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what—look what's going on there and other places.
 Biden is using mafia talking points: ""The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want."" That's what it is. ""The mob will leave you alone. Give them what you want."" But it doesn't work that way, because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking.
 What happens is, you give and give and give, and you take, and they no longer respect you. And that's what's happened with the Democrats, because I actually think they've lost control of these radical-left maniacs. I think they've lost control, because I don't think they feel that's helping them—when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland, and you look at Baltimore, and you look at so many different places and what's going on there. The top 10 are all run by Democrats, and you can go a lot further down the list than 10.
 In America, we will never surrender to mob rule, because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we're continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don't even think about it. They wake up the next morning; they don't even think about it.
 This is the extreme left's agenda for America: They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and Federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers.
 No one will be safe. And, in fact, they want very much to let people in prison—like, as an example, the Boston bomber—they want to let everybody vote. If you're in prison, if you're the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don't know, I don't think that sells too well.
 My administration is a very different approach. We want States to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard. We're prepared. We're ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country—East Coast, West Coast, doesn't matter—we're ready to move immediately, as we did in Minneapolis, as we did—we are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine. Tomorrow I'm going to a place where we moved very quickly—you know that—in Wisconsin. And we moved very, very quickly. And as soon as we moved, that was the end of that. It was very well behaved.
 I'll appoint more tough-on-crime prosecutors, support stiffer penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows. And we need order. We need order. You can't have cities run like these cities are run.
 They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more. And all of a sudden, they've lost these cities, but I'll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, ""Please come in."" As you know, they have to ask—unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don't like to do that—they have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we'll be there within a matter of minutes.
 When I signed the Executive order outlining 10-year prison sentences, as an example, for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was 3 months ago or so. I signed an order, and it said, ""Ten years in prison."" Ten years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge, I haven't seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They canceled that march. They said 10 years is too long.
 Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime. In the last 2 years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest 2-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.
 In the first 2 years of my Presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation LeGend, surging Federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. And we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot.
 Since the beginning of Operation LeGend, we have conducted more than 1,000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third; got it down 33 percent. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don't know that, but we sent them into Chicago without fanfare at all. But we cut it down in half; it's still far too high. And if they'd ask for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we'd be able to cut it down to a very low number.
 While I am President, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe. And we do—we honor our police; we honor our law enforcement.
 I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of—the sheriffs in Florida—all of them; law enforcement, Ohio, in Texas, North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I've gotten all of it. We'll have to do a little study so I'm totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn't, I think we have to look at them, where do they come from.
 So we've done a real job. We're ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don't even have to put it in writing. We'll put it in writing later. We'll get them in there, and we'll straighten out the city very quickly, whichever city we may be talking about. So those Governors that are responsible for a State that has a city that's got a lot of problems: Call me or the mayor can call me, and we'll be there very quickly.
 Tomorrow we're making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we're proud of it, because, in 6 days, it's been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.
 Okay, please. Thank you.
 Protests and Civil Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin 
 Protests and Civil Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin  Q. Mr. President, are you giving any consideration—or did you give any consideration to the Governor and mayor's request not to come to Kenosha tomorrow?
 Q.  The President. No, because Kenosha was something we did a good job on. The Governor didn't want us there. He didn't want the National Guard, as you know. He was very reluctant. But I give him credit because, ultimately, he said yes. And as soon as he said yes, the problem ended.
 The President. But I have to see the people that did such a good job for me. And we're meeting with numerous people. And we have tremendous support in the State of Wisconsin. So I promised them, when it all gets taken care of, we'll go.
 Q. They expressed concerns though that it could exacerbate tensions and increase violence. Do you give any consideration to that?
 Q.  The President. Well, it could also increase enthusiasm, and it could increase love and respect for our country. And that's why I'm going, because they did a fantastic job. As soon as I called and told them, ""Let's go,"" the whole problem stopped. That was—what?—6 days ago.
 The President. Yes, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].
 Shooting of Jacob Blake, Jr., by Police in Kenosha, Wisconsin 
 Shooting of Jacob Blake, Jr., by Police in Kenosha, Wisconsin  Q. Mr. President, why are you not meeting with the family of Jacob Blake while you're there?
 Q.  The President. Well, I spoke with the pastor—a wonderful man—the family's pastor. And I thought it would be better not to do anything where there are lawyers involved. They wanted me to speak, but they wanted to have lawyers involved, and I thought that was inappropriate, so I didn't do that. But I did speak with the pastor of the family, who is a fine man, a wonderful man. And I think we had a great talk.
 The President. And I may, at some point, you know, do that. But they did have a lawyer that wanted to be on the phone, and I said, ""No, that's inappropriate,"" but I just gave my best regards. But, again, I spoke with the pastor.
 Yes, please.
 Protests and Civil Unrest in Portland, Oregon 
 Protests and Civil Unrest in Portland, Oregon  Q. I have a question on coronavirus. But first, you were just criticizing Joe Biden, saying he didn't mention the far left or Antifa during his speech today. You said you wanted to talk about left-wing political violence.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. But I notice you did not mention that your supporters were also in Portland this weekend, firing paintball guns at people, some form of pepper spray. So do you want to also take this chance to condemn what your supporters did in Portland?
 Q.  The President. Well, I understand they had large numbers of people that were supporters, but that was a peaceful protest. And paint is not—and paint is a defensive mechanism; paint is not bullets.
 The President. Q. It's a paintball gun. It's a bullet.
 Q.  The President. Your supporters—your supporters—and they are your supporters, indeed—shot a young gentleman who—and killed him—not with paint, but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful.
 The President. These people, they protested peacefully. They went in very peacefully. And I'll tell you what they're protesting: They're protesting, when they turn on television or read whatever they may be reading, and they see a city like Chicago, where 78 people were shot and 13 died; or a city like New York, where the crime rate has gone through the roof; or a city like Portland, where the entire city is ablaze all the time, and a mayor says, ""We don't want any help from the Federal Government.""
 When these people turn that on and they see that, they say: ""This is not our country. This is not our country."" That was a peaceful protest, totally.
 Q. But it was a supporter of yours, Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Okay, go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. It was a supporter——
 Q.  The President. Yes, go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  Q. It was a supporter of yours, Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. Are you going to condemn the——
 Q.  Q. No, no, it was a supporter of yours, Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Excuse me?
 The President. Q. ——who killed someone, who is accused of killing two people.
 Q.  The President. Excuse me?
 The President. Q. It was a supporter of yours. No——
 Q.  Protests and Civil Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin 
 Protests and Civil Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin  Q. To follow up on what Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN] was saying, are you going to condemn the actions of vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse?
 Q.  The President. We're looking at all of it. And that was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we're looking at right now, and it's under investigation.
 The President. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been—I—he probably would have been killed.
 Q. But do you think——
 Q.  The President. It's under—it's under investigation.
 The President. Use of Force by Law Enforcement Officers/The President's Respect for Law Enforcement 
 Use of Force by Law Enforcement Officers/The President's Respect for Law Enforcement  Q. Do you think private citizens should be taking guns—[inaudible]?
 Q.  inaudible The President. I'd like to see law enforcement take care of everything. I think everything should be taken care of—law enforcement.
 The President. But again, we have to give our cops back, our police back their dignity, their respect. They're very talented people. They're strong. They're tough. They can do the job, but we've taken it away. We don't want to have—when somebody makes a mistake, he chokes, or—in some cases, you have bad cops, and we have to take care of that.
 In other cases, they choke. They're under—they have a quarter of a second—a quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes, they make the wrong decision. If they make the wrong decision—you know, if they make the wrong decision in the other direction, they're probably dead. So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks.
 And the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake——
 And again, the bad cops—everybody agrees they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good—a good police person, right? Good. But they choke. You know, the timing—and they go through this, and they study this, and they work on it all the time. They literally have a quarter of a second to make some of these decisions. And they make a wrong decision, and it's very devastating.
 But I will say this: I honor law enforcement. We wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for law enforcement. We have to stop this horrible, left-wing ideology that seems to be permeating our country. And basically, it's weakness. It's weakness on behalf of Democrat politicians.
 The Republicans, we don't have problems. You take a look at our cities; our cities are doing very well. They're safe. They're secure. I spent a lot of time in Texas, as you know, just a couple of days ago. And I was with the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. He was explaining they wouldn't put up with it for a minute. They just don't have the kind of problems that other people have.
 Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

"26","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 04, 2020        ","The President. Thank you, everybody, very much. Thank you. So, as we begin Labor Day weekend, America's unprecedented economic recovery continues. You see what's going on. It's been pretty amazing. The United States economy added today—announced this morning—1.4 million jobs last month, bringing the total to over 10.6 million jobs created in just 4 months. That's a record, by far.
 The President. In August, we added 249,000 retail jobs; 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs; and 29,000 new manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate plummeted to 8.4 percent, the second largest single-month drop ever recorded, surpassed only by our big decline in June.
 Last month, we saw large declines in the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans—very big declines. We're witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history, by far. By contrast, the last administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history. That was well documented, as you know.
 This year, the United States has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western Nation, and we are recovering at a much faster rate than any other nation. Business confidence is higher today in America than in any other G-7 or EU country—that covers a lot of territory. So we have the business confidence is higher than many—than any of those countries.
 In July, retail sales not only recovered, but reached a new alltime high. So think of that: retail sales. That's a very basic statistic, and it's a big statistic. It not only recovered, but reached the highest level ever. Auto sales have surged to an incredible 74 percent since their April low and are nearly back to their previrus levels. And that's been a tremendous thing. Used cars and new cars have been both doing incredibly well.
 Mortgage applications were 27-percent higher in August than during the same period last year. Homebuilder sentiment reached the highest level on record, indicating that more high-paying construction jobs are on the way. Homebuilding has been great, and lending has been really incredible. U.S. manufacturing activity reached a 19-month high in August.
 While my administration has fought every day to restore prosperity, however, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are holding additional China virus relief hostage to reasons that nobody understands. I guess I do; I think I understand. It's called politics.
 And speaking of politics, I think North Carolina, I think that Michigan and Pennsylvania and other States, they should open. The Governors—the Democrat Governors—should open their States. They'll open them on November 4. But they should open them now. It's very unfair to the people to have those shutdowns continuing at the level that they're continuing.
 Democrats are insisting on a massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue States, stimulus checks for illegal aliens, and the mass release of inmates from jail. They want to release a lot of inmates, some of them for very serious reasons. They want to release them from jail. They want that part—as part of a stimulus package, can you believe it?
 It's time for the Democrats in Congress to start working across the aisle and put the American people first. Now, we have $300 billion in an account that we didn't use—$300 billion. And we are willing to use that. I would be willing to release it, subject to Congress, and use that as stimulus money, and it would go right to the American people. So we have $300 billion sitting in an account that we didn't need because things are going so well with the economy.
 But it would be a very appropriate thing to release that to the American people, and I am willing to do it; all we need is a signoff. But that doesn't mean that we're going to release prisoners. Some prisoners—some very vicious people, actually. We're not going to put them on the streets like the Democrats want us to, and we're not going to give stimulus checks to illegal aliens. They came into the country illegally, and now we give them a check? We want to give the checks to the American people.
 So, remember, we have $300 million [billion]*; it's there. We don't need the money. We don't need anything. Just let that money get released to the American people.
 As our economy rebounds, there's only one thing that could stop the extraordinary economic comeback and wipe out the future of American workers—and that's what the Democrats want to do with a $4 trillion tax hike—implementing things that will be really bad for our country. And this will just absolutely cripple what we're doing on regulations and so many other elements of success.
 We had the greatest economy in history, prior to the China virus coming in. Now they want to stop regulations. They want to bring up regulations to a level—stop the things that we're doing, which are at a much smaller level, and bring up regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before.
 They want to do things that will make it impossible for any economy to grow. They want to ban fracking. And as you saw—ban, ban, ban. And all of a sudden, he sees his polls going down, and now he says, ""Well, I was only talking about not maybe banning fracking,"" but he wants to ban fracking.
 And it doesn't matter what he wants to ban; the people that control him want to ban fracking. And whether it's Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota—so many other States—you can't ban fracking. That would be a disaster—Ohio. They want to abolish American energy—I mean, that's what's going to happen—adopt disastrous trade deals, and inflict a devastating shutdown.
 As you know, he said we want to shut it down: ""We would be willing to shut it down."" And you don't shut down when we're setting records. And by the way, we're rounding the corner. We're rounding the corner on the virus.
 Joe Biden's blanket shutdown would collapse our economy. It would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and more. You know, shutdowns cause a lot of problems—a lot of very serious problems—more so than the virus itself. Biden's plan is not a solution, it's a virtual surrender.
 And our country is doing so well. We're starting to do so well. I think we're going to have a great third quarter. I mean, you're going to see for yourself, because the numbers will be announced sometime prior to the election on November 3.
 And as you know, Joe spent his entire career sending American jobs to China and other faraway countries. For 47 years, people were pillaging our country: taking our jobs, taking our companies. And that's never going to change with that mindset and with that group. Biden is not going to be standing up to these foreign countries. He's not going to be standing up—maybe more importantly—to the people that run the Democrat Party. He doesn't have the strength to do that.
 He refuses even to condemn Antifa, a bad group, a far-left domestic terrorist organization. He doesn't want to say anything bad about it. His plan to appease to the domestic terrorists is the exact opposite of what I'm doing now. And I think you saw that last night.
 Yesterday the U.S. Marshals—we sent them in. U.S. Marshals. We were waiting for local government to take care of it, but they didn't do that, so the U.S. Marshals went in—law enforcement. They took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland. The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon, when officers attempted to take him into custody. They wanted to take him in—the U.S. Marshals, incredible people.
 So I want to thank them for their strength, their bravery. And I really do wish that the mayor of Portland and the Governor of Oregon would get going and stop the crime in that city. It'd be so easy to do.
 While we're focused on creating good-paying jobs, the radical left is focused on unleashing really violent mobs. And you see that. Whether you're conservative or liberal; Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we must all agree the need for peace and order and safety.
 Under my administration, law enforcement is conducting arrests nationwide of rioters, looters, and domestic terrorists. The reason we didn't put Chicago into our list—where we're holding back funds from some of these States and cities that are doing such a poor job, such an incompetent job—a job that nobody can even imagine how bad. And we're holding it back until they get their act together.
 And we are having a lot of people in Chicago right now, and you notice that their numbers are going down rapidly. But we have—we've deployed a lot of Federal law enforcement inside of Chicago, and they're taking out quite a few people. And they're being arrested; they're being put in jail. And that's why you see those numbers going down. That's why you see that, with respect to the mayor, we did not hold back funds in Chicago.
 But New York is experiencing a tremendous crime wave, in some cases, up over 300 percent. And they have to do something quickly.
 We just spoke to Mayor Bowser, and she's willing to do whatever is necessary. We had a very good talk with her. That's in DC.
 And the other places, they speak for themselves.
 We're working with the State and local authorities to comb through hours of videotape, identifying arrest suspects; and prosecute lawbreakers. We've already got over 300 in jail, and we have tremendous evidence.
 And I want to thank the media for helping us out, because they're taking different angles—we have it from every different angle. You can't probably have any better than what we've got. We see it from the sky and the ground and from the right and from the left. So when they say they didn't do it, we say, ""Well, what's this?"" So we get that from the media, free of charge.
 Under Operation LeGend, we've surged Federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. The initiative has already resulted in tremendous success. And nationwide, we have over 2,000 arrests. And we don't talk about it too much, but now we might as well. So we've arrested over 2,000 criminals. They're criminals. And in a single month, murder rate in Chicago—as you know, and as I said—it was cut in half, actually.
 So, on the China virus front, the nations of Europe have experienced a 38-percent greater excess mortality than the United States—38-percent more—greater—excess mortality than the United States. A lot of you don't want to report that. And if we took New York into the—out of the equation, there's nobody even close. The job we've done is incredible. And we don't get any credit for it, but we've done an incredible job.
 Through Operation Warp Speed, we have three vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. Yesterday Pfizer announced—I just spoke to the head of Pfizer, great guy—they announced that it expects to have the results of its trial very, very shortly—next month—but very shortly.
 We remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1. We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October. And Pfizer is among the leaders, as you know, and it's a great company. Johnson and Johnson also doing very well. Moderna. We have some really great companies. They're all doing very well. They're all in final stages, and I think you're going to see results that are shockingly good.
 Finally, I want to provide you with a brief update of the virus. Cases in the United States have declined 28 percent nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline over the past week—very substantially decline.
 Thanks to America's medical genius, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 percent in April. Mortality rate reduced by 85 percent. Hospital lengths of stay are one-third of their average length in April. So the hospitalization is down. The length of stay is way down.
 In order to keep making progress against the virus, we ask all Americans to remain vigilant, especially over Labor Day. You know, you have the Labor Day weekend coming upon us immediately—I guess we can say—pretty immediately. And we need everybody to be careful, to apply common sense, and do all of the things that we've told you to do as quickly—as much as you can—social distancing, wearing a mask whenever the distancing is not possible, and staying like—staying with a group that you know.
 Let's just try and get through this one weekend, and I think we have a chance of doing that. Just social distance, wash your hands—all of the hygiene things that we speak about. And we're really rounding the turn.
 And the vaccines are coming. The therapeutics have already come, but they continue to come. The convalescent plasma has had a tremendous impact already; you see what's happening there. And remdesivir has been incredible.
 So we have a lot of things happening. We have a lot of therapeutics coming out. I think—from the standpoint of common sense, I guess, therapeutics, to me—right now you go into a hospital, you give somebody a shot or a transfusion. It might be a transfusion; probably more than 50 percent are actually transfusions. And they'll leave the hospital shortly thereafter. I mean, to me, that's more important, in a certain sense, than the vaccine. But the vaccines will be great over the long term; the therapeutics over the short term.
 And also knowing you have the therapeutics, I think, is great from the standpoint of mind—from the standpoint of the mind. That's great.
 So I want to thank everybody for being here. I'm going to ask Larry Kudlow to give a couple of examples of how strong our economy is recovering, how strongly it's recovering. And it's setting records at every level, and we're doing better than every other country. And we're very proud of all of the people for doing such an incredible job. This is a ""V."" It's a ""super V.""
 Again, we have $300 billion ready to go. All Congress has to do is say, ""Use it."" If they say, ""Use it""—I'd like to use it without their permission, but I guess I'm not allowed to do that. I did ask that question. So Congress has to just say, ""Use it."" All they have to do is say, ""Use it""; $300 billion gets immediately put into our system and will really help the American people. There's nothing else to do—just a very quick statement. So I'm going to ask Larry to come up. I want to thank another man for being here today. There's a man that's a incredible leader: Lou Holtz. I've known him for a long time. He's been a friend of mine. And I think I've received letters from every football coach, almost, in the Nation. And that's a little exaggeration, but some of the greats. Nick Saban wrote a letter. Coach O—and Coach O is central casting. I said, ""We're going to have to put him in a movie""—right?—""as a football coach."" He'd really be good playing a football coach like you. And Urban Meyer wrote a beautiful letter. And so many of the other great, legendary coaches.
 Not only coaches though—people in sports and people in life and even great political people, recommending Lou for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we've analyzed it very closely. We've looked at all of those recommendations. We've looked at Lou's life and his career and what he's done for charity. And the football is obvious—he was a great coach—but what he's done, beyond even coaching.
 So Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And a date is being picked; it won't be in the too-distant future. Lou was married to a great woman. Right, Lou? A great woman. And she just passed away a few months ago. This is an incredible woman. She was stronger—I knew her; I knew her well—she was stronger than Lou. [Laughter] I think she was stronger than you, Lou, I hate to tell you. You're strong, too. But she was special, right?
 Laughter So I just want to congratulate Coach Lou Holtz on—soon to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we look forward to that, Lou. Thank you very much. And you can stay around and listen to Larry for a couple of seconds or——
 Former college football coach Louis L. Holtz. I listen to Larry——
 Former college football coach Louis L. Holtz The President. ——or go to your friend.
 The President.  Mr. Holtz. ——every chance I can.
 Mr. Holtz The President. You probably know half of the people in the room. I'll bet they treat you better than they treat me. They treat him good. I wish you'd treat me that way.
 The President. Larry, come on up.
 National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. Thank you, sir. Thanks, sir. I appreciate it. Again, Coach, many congrats. Many, many congrats.
 National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow. Just to underscore the President's assessment of the economy: very strong jobs report today, 8.4-percent unemployment rate, 1.4 million payrolls increase. But I want to add: 3.8 million—3.8 million—increase in the important household survey, which aims at small businesses particularly, and from which the unemployment is calculated. In the past 4 months, we've generated a 10.6 million increase in payrolls and a 14 million increase in households. So we've restored basically half of the jobs that were lost in the pandemic contraction.
 [At this point, Director Kudlow continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
 At this point, Director Kudlow continued his remarks, concluding as follows But all I can say is, factually, the numbers are coming in very positively. There's a lot of optimism going on. More work to be done, but we're rolling in the right direction, sir.
 Thank you. Appreciate it.
 The President. Thank you, Larry, very much.
 The President. Okay, please.
 Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Thank you, President Trump. If I could first ask a clarifying question about the $300 billion——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President Q. You've ruled out doing that unilaterally. You're going to wait for Congress to repurpose it for stimulus checks.
 Q.  The President. Yes. What about it?
 The President. Q. No, is that correct: You're waiting for Congress?
 Q.  The President. Well, I am. You know, there's a theory that I can do it without the approval, but I'd rather get the approval so that we have it. But there's a theory I could take the $300 billion. It's money that we have—money that we built up and money that we haven't spent, and I would love to give it to the American people as a very powerful stimulus. So yes.
 The President. I think there is a theory that I could do it without having to go back, but I think it would be appropriate to go back, and I would ask Congress to approve it. It's a very simple approval. It's—literally, it's a one-sentence approval, and the Democrats should do that. The Republicans will do that. They would be glad to do that. So we'll see whether or not they do it. Okay?
 Please, in the back.
 The President's Support From Law Enforcement Organizations 
 The President's Support From Law Enforcement Organizations  Q. Yes, Mr. President, our editor in chief, John Solomon, had an exclusive interview with the head of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police chapter. He said that they were going to endorse you instead of their native son, Joe Biden.
 Q.  The President. Right.
 The President Q. I'd like your response. As well as—the national organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, is endorsing you as well.
 Q.  The President. Well, I'm honored that Delaware—because I don't see Biden anywhere but Delaware. He's—and I like Delaware too. But to have the law enforcement in Delaware give their endorsement to me is really a great honor. It's really—it just shows you how pathetic the Democrats are when it comes to crime, when it comes to law and order.
 The President. So would you please extend my very great thanks? That's a great honor to get it from Delaware law enforcement. We've gotten it from almost all law enforcement, but that's—that's a—because every time I see Biden speak, it says, ""Delaware, Delaware, Delaware."" He never leaves. I'm all over the country; I'm all over the place.
 Yes, please. Go ahead. Did you have? Yes, go ahead, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].
 Russia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/The President's Foreign Policy Record/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
 Russia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/The President's Foreign Policy Record/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Germany has said that Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was poisoned. What do you think should be done to Russia about that? And what is your message to Russia about that? And how should the international community and the United States respond?
 Q.  The President. Well, I think we have to look at it very seriously if that's the case, and I think we will. There's nobody been tougher on Russia than I have. We get along. I get along with almost all countries.
 The President. I get along with North Korea. Remember? We were supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. That would be a very messy war, a very bad war. Many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I'd be at war in 1 week; it's been just the opposite.
 We're doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down—very low level—and other things are happening. Very interestingly, we have a great peace deal going on in the Middle East, actually, with U.A.E. and Israel. And that's been received like, probably, very few things that many people have done. It's been very well received. And we'll be having other countries announcing soon; they're joining that, and you're going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, ""Hey, why didn't you bring us in right from the beginning?"" They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in.
 So we're doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world: Nord Stream 2. I said: ""Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia, and then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia? What's that all about?"" And the sanctions and everything else.
 At the same time, with Russia, we're right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It's a very important thing. To me, it's the most important thing. Some people say ""global warming;"" I don't. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest; they are the second biggest, nuclear-wise. China is third. They're actually a distant third, but they're building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we'll include China into those talks, but we're doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation.
 So I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic. It's terrible. It shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet, but I will take a look.
 Q. Do you doubt it?
 Q.  The President. It is interesting that everybody is always mentioning Russia. And I don't mind you mentioning Russia, but I think probably China, at this point, is a nation that you should be talking about much more so than Russia because the things that China is doing are far worse, if you take a look at what's happening with the world.
 The President. Look at what happened with the China virus. Look at what they did by not keeping that within the confines of China. They should have kept it in the confines of China. Look what they've done to 188 countries all over the world. But you never ask about China; you're always asking about Russia.
 So I would be very angry if that's the case, and we'll take a look at the numbers and the documents, because we're going to be sent a lot of documents over the next few days.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Not—please, in the back.
 The President. India-U.S. Relations/India-China Relations 
 India-U.S. Relations/India-China Relations  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. During the conventions, Kimberly—thank you.
 Q.  The President. Thank you.
 The President Q. During the conventions, Kimberly and Don Jr. had the outreach—the Indian American community—with a video called ""Four More Years"" for you, which has gone viral among the Indian Americans in the battleground States.
 Q.  So my question is: Would Kimberly, Don Jr., and Ivanka Trump, who are very popular among Indian Americans—would be campaigning on your behalf around the Indian Americans with your views on the India and U.S. relationship?
 The President. Well, I didn't understand everything you said. I know India, and I understood—those young people that you mentioned. They're very good, young people. And I know their relationship to India is very good, and so is mine.
 The President. And Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine, and he's doing a very good job. Nothing easy—nothing easy, but he's doing a very good job.
 We're talking—I mean, while we're at it, we're talking about China and India. They're pretty—going at a pretty good on the border, as you know. It's been very nasty. It's been a very nasty situation, and we stand ready to help, with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help, and we are talking to both countries about that.
 But I appreciate your nice sentiments. They think a lot of India, and so do I. And I think a lot of your Prime Minister. Thank you.
 Q. My question—sir, my question was about Indian Americans. Do you think they are voting for you or are you—are they supporting you—[inaudible]?
 Q.  inaudible The President. I do. We had a—an event in Houston, as you know, and it was a fantastic event. I was invited by Prime Minister Modi. And this was a massive—this was at the—where they play football—the Houston football team. And it was incredible. It was actually incredible. And the Prime Minister could not have been more generous.
 The President. We have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi. And I would think that the people—Indian people—would be voting for Trump. I also, as you know, went to India, just prior to the pandemic setting in, because India has been hit very hard. Left, really, about a week before that.
 And we had an incredible time. What— we saw—the people are so incredible. It's really an incredible place, an incredible country, and it's definitely big. It's definitely big.
 But you've got a great leader, and he's a great, great person.
 Q. Thank you, sir. Do you think China is bullying India?
 Q.  The President. I hope not. I hope not, but they're certainly going at it. They're going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand.
 The President. Yes, please, go ahead.
 Q. Thank you, sir.
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Russia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
 Russia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. Thank you, sir. Just to follow up on Alexei Navalny: You just said you—you haven't had any proof yet. Do you have any reasons to doubt the results from Germany?
 Q.  The President. No, I don't. I mean, I don't. I hear Germany has made a—was it definitive, or almost definitive? But we have not seen it ourselves, no. But we have not seen it ourselves.
 The President. But I would certainly be okay with that. They want to do something. They want to take action. Shouldn't happen. Shouldn't happen.
 But again, we are working very closely with a lot of countries on a lot of different things. We've taken stronger action against Russia than any other country in the world, as you know. I'll tell you, President Putin would tell you that right now.
 Q. Do you intend to—[inaudible]—with him?
 Q.  inaudible The President. But the fact that I—the fact that I get along with Russia and that I get along, frankly, with everybody—right now, I'm not getting along with China, but that's my choice. I don't like what happened with respect to the pandemic, with respect to the China virus. I don't like it at all. What they've done to this world and this country and Europe and everyplace else is terrible.
 The President. But I do get along with—with President Putin. But I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, by far.
 If you look at the Obama administration, they were weak. Look at the land they gave up. Look at what happened with respect to—look at what happened with respect to Ukraine. Such a big part of Ukraine given up during the Obama administration. And I don't think they would have done that with me. I don't think they would have done that with me at all.
 We gave tank busters, and they gave pillows. Do you ever hear that expression? They sent pillows, and we sent tank busters to Ukraine.
 So—but with that being said, if we can do a nuclear nonproliferation agreement, that would be a great thing. No, but I would not be at all happy if that were the case. And it looks like it might very well be the case. I mean, based on what Germany——
 Q. [Inaudible]—raise the issue with President Putin?
 Q.  Inaudible The President. ——based on what Germany is saying, that seems to be the case.
 The President.  Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].
 Former Senator John S. McCain III 
 Former Senator John S. McCain III  Q. Mr. President, I just want to ask you about something you said a while back; it's been talked about many, many, times. Back in 2015, you said that you didn't think John McCain was a hero, that you prefer people who don't get captured.
 Q.  In light of all that's happened since then and all you've learned, do you regret saying that? Is that something you wish you had not said?
 The President. I—look, I say what I say. And I never got along with John McCain. I disagreed with John McCain. You know that better than anybody, frankly. I wasn't a fan. I disagreed with many of his views. I disagreed with his views on these ridiculous, endless wars. I disagreed with the way he handled the vets, the VA. The VA is running much better now—and we did with the MISSION Act and the accountability and all the things we've done for the VA. He was not able to do that.
 The President. But I disagreed with John McCain on a lot of things. That doesn't mean I don't respect him. I respected him, but I really disagreed with him on a lot of things. And I think I was right; I think time has proven me right, to a large extent.
 Q. But on this notion of referring to people who are captured, the——
 Q.  The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 The President. Federal Coronavirus Response/Global Coronavirus Pandemic 
 Federal Coronavirus Response/Global Coronavirus Pandemic  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Earlier in the statement that you read before questions, you spoke about how you believe that we're, as you put it, ""rounding the corner"" on the coronavirus pandemic.
 Q.  The President. Yes. I do believe that. Yes. Q. And you said that yesterday as well. And I think everybody would love to see the pandemic come to an end; there's no doubt about that.
 The President. Q.  But I wanted to ask you about a forecast that has come out from the IHME at the University of Washington. And they're forecasting, by January the 1st of next year, that we'll have 410,000 American deaths from coronavirus, which is 225,000 from where we are right now. So can you explain how you see us ""rounding the corner""——
 The President. Sure.
 Q. ——based upon that projection?
 Q.  The President. If I didn't close up our country; if I didn't stop, China—highly infected—from coming in; if I didn't stop Europe from coming in far sooner than anybody else, including Dr. Fauci and others, wanted to—and Dr. Fauci was very nice; he said, ""President Trump made a great decision""—we would have far more than that.
 The President. But maybe even more importantly, if I didn't close up, we would have—instead of the number that you mentioned or whatever it may be—it were—about 180—we would have perhaps 1½ or 2 million deaths right now if I went a different direction, which some people wanted me to do. And I decided not to do it. We'd have 2 million deaths.
 Now, a lot of countries don't report their deaths. Obviously, China is not reporting, because they had far more than we did. China had far more deaths than we did, in my opinion. It's just my opinion. But they don't report their deaths or they don't report them accurately. And I could—I don't want to embarrass other countries, but I can tell you, there are other countries where the death toll is far higher than the United States, but they don't report to us. We report it to a level that nobody reports it.
 We also do testing in cases—I watch your broadcasts and your—I read your information—your media outlets—very, very carefully. And I look at the word ""cases."" And the reason, you know, it's—I say it 100 times; nobody wants to pick it up. But we do testing at a level that nobody ever dreamed possible. We have the best test, and we have, by far, the most tests.
 Actually, India, as per your question before—India is number two, and they've done a good job. But they're about 40 million tests behind us, and they're a country of 1.5 billion people.
 Now, because of all these tests, we have far more cases. If we cut our cases in half, if we—if we cut our testing in half, we'd probably have about half the number of cases. If we cut it down to levels—there are some countries that don't test. They test when somebody walks into a hospital; that's the test you get. They walk into a hospital, they're sick; that's your test.
 We have tested more and better. And you just see where we now have millions of tests coming in from a certain company that's done a fantastic job, and it's going to be anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes on the spot—very accurate test.
 But if we had much less testing, no testing, we would have—you wouldn't be reporting cases. But you saw this—I don't want to go over the statistics. You all wrote it down. But you see how we're doing compared to the rest of the world, and you see—and if you took out New York, which has been a tragic situation with the amount of people that died in New York——
 Q. But that's part of the U.S.
 Q.  The President. ——and in the nursing home.
 The President.  Q. You can't just take out a major State in the U.S. It's still a part of the United States, New York is.
 Q.  The President. No, I'm just saying——
 The President. Q. You can't take it out of the equation.
 Q.  The President. If you took—sure. I'm just saying: New York has been, in particular, run—whether it's badly, incompetently; whether it's unfortunate—and I appreciated Governor Cuomo saying that I've done a phenomenal job, and he said very good things. He said bad things too, you know, later on, when he had no real other choice. But if you took out New York from those numbers, you can multiply our tremendous success by a lot.
 The President. But look, the bottom line is that the job we've done on COVID-19 or the China virus, China plague—call it whatever you want; got a lot of different names—but it's been incredible. And we've also helped a lot of other countries, especially with ventilators, because we are now—you know, we built ventilators at a level that nobody ever thought possible. So——
 Q. So you don't see that forecast being accurate, the one that I cited you?
 Q.  The President. No, look. Look. Yes, but you didn't hear me. If we didn't do what I said, we would be at 2 million deaths right now.
 The President. Q. But they're taking that into account. It's just going forward.
 Q.  The President. No, they're not taking that into account. I had a choice to make; if we made the wrong choice, the number that you have, which is less than other countries—but the other countries don't report tests. They don't report them to the extent, and they're not accurate. You know that, and so do I. Because we have—you take a look at some of the things happening in certain other very large countries. First of all, we're a very large country. But you take a look at things happening with respect to the reporting of deaths in other countries, and I say, ""Give me a break.""
 The President. So it's been amazing. But we made some moves at the beginning: China, big; Europe, big. But the biggest of all was closing it down, understanding the disease. And we did, and now we know it's the elderly. It's especially elderly if they have heart, diabetes—if they have problems. And we're watching it, and we're watching it very closely. And by the way, we're doing supertesting with respect to that—supertesting.
 But if we did it a different way, instead of the number that you said—but basically, the number that we're at now is approximately 180,000—we'd be at 2 million people right now. Could be higher than that.
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development  Q. Have you spoken to——
 Q.  The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 The President. Q. ——President Putin about the Russia—the Russia vaccine, Mr. President? The Russia vaccine?
 Q.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President.
 Q.  The President. I don't know anything about the Russia vaccine. I'm not sure. We have our vaccine, and our vaccine is—I think, it's going to be the standard. It's going to be great. And these companies are incredible. They've come up with the great vaccines over the years, and that's the vaccine that probably most of the people in this room are going to want to take. All right?
 The President. Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. A quick clarification, and then my question. The $300 billion, is that from the Main Street Lending Program, or is that from a different part? Where are you pulling it?
 Q.  The President. It's sitting in an account; has not been spent, but we're willing to spend it.
 The President. Q. But you're not sure which account.
 Q.  The President. No, we're willing to spend it. I'd like to get approval from Congress. There's a theory that I don't have to do that, but I'd rather be up front, and I'd like to get approval from Congress. Let it go directly to the people. It would be a great stimulus. It's actually more stimulus than we're asking for, in terms of pure stimulus. This would be pure stimulus.
 The President. I wouldn't have to let prisoners go—some very evil prisoners go. Like, think of it: The Democrats, in order to get what they want and in order to give us what we—they're talking about allowing prisoners to be released; prisoners that we don't want to be released. So in order that we get money to the American people, they want to say ""release prisoners"" and other things like that that are very bad. And we just can't do that. We don't want to do that.
 The President's Feelings Regarding U.S. Servicemembers/News Media/Veterans 
 The President's Feelings Regarding U.S. Servicemembers/News Media/Veterans  Q. And then, just to follow on Jon's question: I know you spoke you earlier about the Atlantic story, and you referenced the number of administration officials who have come out to support your——
 Q.  The President. Well, no, we have 11 people. I was just told—I was just told we have 11 people. There is nobody that feels more strongly about our soldiers, our wounded warriors, our soldiers that died in war, than I do. It's a hoax, just like the fake dossier was a hoax, just like the ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" was a hoax. It was a total hoax. No collusion. Just like so many other things. It's a hoax.
 The President. And you'll hear more of these things, totally unrelated, as we get closer and closer to election. The magazine is a failing magazine, and nobody called me—nobody called me from the magazine and said, ""Do you have a comment about it?"" No, they just write whatever they want to write, because they figure you can't get sued. You can't get sued, but it's very—it's a very hard—bringing lawsuits.
 But we have many witnesses, and it's a total—it's just a continuation of the witch hunt, so that it can, hopefully, effect the election.
 But the American people are too smart. So whether it's the fake dossier that turned out to be a total fraud or so many other things—so many other things have turned out. I've been under investigation from before I even get elected. These people have gone after me more than any President in the United States in history—in the history of the United States. And it's a shame. It's a shame.
 And despite that, we've done more in the first 3½ years than any administration. There's been no administration that's done more. When you add it all up, there's been no—despite all of the horrible political games that have been played.
 But there's nobody that's been—that's been able to do what I've done, and that includes the great MISSION Act, because what Obama passed was a joke. It was a joke. And we took it to a level that nobody thought possible, and that includes accountability.
 So it's a disgrace that somebody is allowed to write things like that. It could have been—you know, a lot of times, the sources aren't sources; they don't exist. And sometimes, the sources are just people that are disgruntled, former so-called employees.
 Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's November 2018 Travel to Paris, France/Defense Spending/National Economy
 Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's November 2018 Travel to Paris, France/Defense Spending/National Economy Q. Well, my question is sort of about that. I mean, the notable voice that's been missing from the denials is your former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who was obviously intimately involved in this. What—how are we supposed to read——
 Q.  The President. Well, look, here's the thing:——
 The President. Q. ——the fact that John Kelly hasn't denied this?
 Q.  The President. I know John Kelly; he was with me. Didn't do a good job, had no temperament, and ultimately, he was petered out. He got—he was exhausted. This man was totally exhausted. He wasn't even able to function in the last number of months. He was not able to function. He was sort of a tough guy. By the time he got eaten up in this world—it's a different world than he was used to—he was unable to function. And I told him: ""John, you're going to have to go. Please give me your letter of resignation."" And we did that. And now he goes out and bad mouths.
 The President. Now, there are people that are jealous. There are people that are upset that they're not here anymore. There are people that—we've done an incredible job. The virus came in, and now we're doing an incredible job again. And we're going to build it up bigger than it was before the virus came in.
 But I don't know that it was him. I haven't seen that. I mean, I see ""Anonymous,"" but it could have been a guy like a John Kelly because he was——
 Q. Did you make that comment at his son's grave?
 Q.  The President. Just so you understand, he was a very—if you look at some of his news conferences, what happened to him: He got eaten alive. He was unable to handle the pressure of this job. This job was a tough job. Mark Meadows is doing a great job, but Kelly was unable to do that.
 The President. And as far as that day, I mean, we have so much proof as to going to the—I went to Paris and the environs, and I was all set to go. They had a rainstorm the likes of which you've rarely seen. The fog was so great; it was as dense as I've ever seen. And I almost knew that you couldn't use the helicopter. And because they had to drive through, I guess, certain parts of Paris, the Secret Service, who—by the way, we have people here that were on the trip. They're writing a report. Unable to even think about it. And I said: ""Nope, I want to go. I insist on going."" It would have taken us forever.
 The Paris police said, ""Please, you can't do this."" They'd have to shut down various parts of Paris, and it just was not a possible situation. The helicopter would have been very quick. They had the helicopter all set, but the helicopter could never fly in that kind of weather. So—and that turned out—and that's all documented, by the way. We have all of the information from—and probably will release that information.
 But I think it's a shame when a second-rate magazine—I don't read it; I know very little about this magazine. But when a second-rate magazine can write things like that about somebody that's done so much for the military, can write things like that and get away with it, where you actually ask questions on it, it's a disgrace, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
 And let me just tell you, I watched the interview with Sleepy Joe Biden, and he didn't ask questions. You didn't ask questions like that. Read the questions you asked. They were, like, meant for a child. Those questions were meant for a child. Smiles on faces of reporters—not like you and you. There were smiles on the reporters. ""What do you think?"" Take a look at those questions that they ask him. They were not meant for a grownup; they were meant for a child.
 Q. Can I ask about law and order?
 Q.  The President. So I just want to just tell you—I just want to tell you it's a disgrace, because if you look at what I've done for the United States military, I love those people. I've gotten them pay raises when they didn't get anything near what I've been able to do. And I've rebuilt—$2.5 trillion. I've rebuilt the United States military. Now we're including Space Force. Nobody has done more for them.
 The President. And then, when I have to have a report read like that from a third-rate magazine that's not going to be in business much longer, I look at that, and I think it's a disgrace. And then, when I watch Biden getting asked questions that are really meant for a child to answer—anybody could answer—and I look at the level of question that you people ask, I mean, honestly, it's disgraceful.
 So I want to thank you all very much.
 Q. Law and order?
 Q.  The President. We appreciate it. And we're doing very well. We're very, very proud of what's happened with respect to the economy. And I think that before the election, you're going to see a third quarter announced. The third quarter will be at a level that our country has never seen before. Next year, we're going to have a year that was better than last year. And I feel very certain it'll be better than last year. It'll be the greatest year we've had.
 The President. And the whole reason this is working out this way is, because we set a foundation for this country like we've never had before. So next year is going to be a fantastic year.
 But remember this: The third quarter is going to be announced sometime prior to the election—by a few days, actually—and I think it's going to be record-setting-type numbers on GDP and other things.
 Thank you all very much. Thank you.
 Q. Law and order, sir? Can I ask about law and order?
 Q.  Q. Stars and Stripes? Stars and Stripes and the decision for the Pentagon—[inaudible]?
 Q. inaudible Q. Did you stand by Robert Kelly's grave and say to his father: ""I don't get it. What was in it for them?"" Q. ","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1259"
"27","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 07, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Labor Day. That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They're very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific.
 The President. So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they're doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It's why I thought we'd do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place.
 The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we're doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we're rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic.
 The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we've have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May—10.6 million jobs since May. That's a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away.
 In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you'd go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that's the second largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines, ""decline"" meaning positive, not negative.
 We're currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history—world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was the—it was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small—very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery.
 Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a ""V"" shape. It's probably a ""super V."" And you see what's going on with the stock market, where it's, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDAQ has set 17 records already, and this is as we're, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic.
 First, we'll end the pandemic. Under Operation Warp Speed, we've pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April. You don't hear that from the press very often. They don't like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85 percent—think of that—since April.
 The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership, we'll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate—the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, who's not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy—should immediately apologize for the reckless antivaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science. And what's happening is, all of a sudden, you'll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric—it's a politic rhetoric; that's all it is. Just for politics. Because now they see we've done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before. This could have taken 2 or 3 years, and instead, it's going to be—[laughter]—it's going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October.
 laughter So, contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine that they're—they politicalize. They'll say anything. And it's so dangerous for our country, what they say. But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon. You could have a very big surprise coming up. I'm sure you'll be very happy. But the people will be happy. The people of the world will be happy.
 Next, we'll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We'll pass new tax cuts to boost take-home pay. We're going to be cutting taxes very substantially. We get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus.
 We'll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. We've—as you know, in 3½ years, we've cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, no matter what period of time you're talking about. We'll enact fair trade deals, and we're working on seven major fair trade deals right now. And when I say ""fair,"" fair to our country—because our country was ripped off by every nation. Friend, foe, didn't matter: Every nation was ripping us off at a level that—it's just unbelievable, to be honest.
 We're going to be expanding Opportunity Zones, and we will keep that going. It's been a tremendous—a tremendous—program. I want to thank Senator Scott, South Carolina, for coming up with that whole concept, because he came up, and I liked it right away, and it was—it's really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African Americans, Hispanic Americans.
 We'll continue to unleash American energy. We're number one in the world. And we're totally energy independent right now. And in 2021, we'll create 10 million jobs, at least, in the first 10 months.
 Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it. You'll have a crash the likes of which you've never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s—remember, it's the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you've never seen before. The Biden plan begins with a $4 trillion tax hike. And that will end everything, including growth. There won't be growth. There will be total contraction.
 Biden has also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He'll have to talk to China, Russia, India, and lots of other countries, because they're not doing that. And if they're not doing it, it puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage, and it doesn't work.
 You take a look at the blackouts in California; it's really rather amazing what's going on there. They've tried to go—and that's just with a small portion going that route. That doesn't work, and it can't fire up our big plants. If we're going to have this great industry that we've created—can't fire up our big plants.
 Biden's plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He's going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, ""Yes, sir, it's time to shut it down."" He'd be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease, and other very serious illnesses. Because when you do a shutdown, there's a problem on the other side; it's not just from the virus. You have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things that—you just take a look. Depression is a massive problem. And what happens is, you—they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can't do that. And then, we'd have to give up all of the gains that I've been talking about over the last 3 months. We've—what we have done is incredible. We're setting records. All over the world, no matter where you go, nobody has done what we've been able to do.
 So we're setting records in jobs. We're setting records in numbers. And you're going to see some very big numbers. Third-quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3. So you have the numbers coming out, and they're, I think, going to be fantastic. You know, I think they're going to be fantastic.
 The best numbers of all, if somebody doesn't come along and raise taxes—double, triple, quadruple your taxes—will be the numbers from next year. But you're going to have a good third-quarter number coming out. And I think it's going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number.
 Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus, he wants to surrender our families to the violent left-wing mob, and he wants to surrender our jobs to China: our jobs and our economic well-being. I've taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. No other President has done what I've done. I've given much of it to the farmers. I've given it to farmers and manufacturers, but I've given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody has done that. We haven't taken in 10 cents from China ever.
 They targeted our farmers, and I targeted them. And I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn't be existent right now. Right now they're very happy. In fact, they're setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they've ever done. Record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef, because they know I'm not happy with them. They know I'm not happy at all.
 And frankly, I don't want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now, but there's been no country anywhere, at any time, that's ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars for years and years, decades. We've lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They get nothing, other than loss, other than giving our money. And they take that money, and they build their military. And you see they're building up a powerful military. And it's very lucky that I've been building our up, because otherwise, we'd be dwarfed right now by China. We would be a terrible thing—a terrible thing.
 We're way ahead on the nuclear front. We've upgraded our nuclear. Hope to God we never have to use it. But we would be in a position that we are not in right now. But China is spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the world ""decouple,"" it's an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn't do business with them, we wouldn't lose billions of dollars. It's called ""decoupling."" So you'll start thinking about it. You'll start thinking.
 They take our money, and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles. And Biden has been just a pawn for them. He's been so easy. They dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes President. If Joe Biden becomes President, China will own the United States, and every other country will be smiling also. They'll be smiling. When reports come out that certain countries don't really like me too much, that's not because of my personality, although it could be that also, frankly. It's because of the fact that I've been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years.
 If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries—we're one of them—every country is way behind. They're delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it, and we're not doing it. I told them; we're not doing it. And they've increased their spending now $130 billion, going up to $400 billion a year. It's all because of me. Then, you hear the country doesn't like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other Presidents, in all fairness, would go in there, and they'd make a speech, and they'd leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said: ""This is unfair. We're paying for NATO."" We're paying for NATO. Almost all of it.
 So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off, with the European Union, on trade. And Biden doesn't have a clue. You know he doesn't have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn't have a clue. In primetime, he wasn't good. And now it's not primetime.
 He spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other countries, while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor.
 His son, ""Where is Hunter?""—Where is Hunter?—I call him ""Where is Hunter?""—walked away with $1½ billion to manage, even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China, and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements. And the press doesn't pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be—it would be hell, even worse than it's been. Okay? Even worse than it's been.
 What he's done is so incredible. ""I won't give them the billion dollars,"" he says. ""I won't give them, unless they get rid of that Prosecutor."" And then, voilá, they got rid of the Prosecutor. And the press doesn't even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he's right on tape, and you don't want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves.
 voilá But Biden shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders, and sent our youth to fight in these crazy endless wars. And it's one of the reasons the military—I'm not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.
 But we're getting out of the endless wars; you know how we're we doing. We defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate—100 percent. When I was in—when I came in, it was a mess; it was all over. They have it, in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, ""Where is it?"" ""It's all gone, sir. Because of you, it's all gone,"" because of my philosophy. But all gone. And I said, ""That's good. Let's bring our soldiers back home. Some people don't like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money."" One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, and that's what it was.
 Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Two disasters. The most disastrous trade deals in history, both of them. I can't tell you which was worse; they were both terrible.
 And as you know, I ended it, and I ended NAFTA. And we're looking at the World Trade Organization. They've become much better—I will say that. We—World Health, I got out of, because we're spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million, and China controlled it. But World Trade, we're looking at it. They've been very nice to us lately—I will say that—amazingly. We never used to win anything at the World Trade; would lose every case. Now, all of a sudden, we're winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case. And they're talking to us much differently than they used to, because if they don't shape up, we're going to ship out. That's all. We're not treated fairly.
 China is treated as a developing nation. Developing nation. We're treated as a nation that's fully developed. We're not fully developed, as far as I'm concerned—when you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities. Take a look at what's happening in New York and Chicago, where you have Democrat-run cities and mayors that are running, and Governors that are running States so badly, and mayors running cities so badly. It's very sad to look at it. It's Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren't. But I don't—so far, I haven't been able to.
 If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster; it would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now—auto plants—in Michigan, just like I said. They're being built in Ohio; they're being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They're being built all over and expanded at a level that we've never seen before, because I said to Japan and Germany and others: ""Sorry, you've got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we're going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.""
 And we got out of the horrible Paris climate accord that he'll go back into, because, you know, it sounds wonderful. It's a disaster for this country. They've basically taken away your wealth, the Paris climate accord. And the other countries don't have to adhere to it. China doesn't kick in until 2030; they don't have to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We would have had to close, under some scenarios, 25 percent of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris climate accord. It sounds good. It was very bad and very expensive.
 The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden's China sell-outs, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, ""The United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules."" They didn't play by the rules. They didn't play by the rules.
 The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it's so bad is that China didn't play by the rules. We did. We did. But their rules were easier because they're considered a developing nation, so they had a much lower standard. But even that, they didn't play by the rules. That's when they became a rocket ship. They were flatlined for years and years and years. Then, they joined the World Trade Organization. And frankly, they cheated. Okay? They cheated. I'll say it. What difference does it make? I feel much differently. I feel I made a great trade deal with China. Great. And they're buying. You know why they're buying? Because they know I'm not happy. That's why they're buying. And I talk about it because today is Labor Day, and it's a good to time talk about when we're being ripped off by countries. But nobody is even close to China.
 Biden cheered China's rise as a great power ""because great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights, and trade."" Well, they didn't. They took advantage of stupid people. Stupid people. And Biden is a stupid person. You know that. You're not going to write it. But you know that.
 The cost of Biden's economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. And I heard this morning, the real number is probably 70,000—70,000 shuttered American factories. And he's talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad, on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses—nothing near this serious—but the swine, and we had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why. If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country. If Biden wins, China will own this country, and hopefully, you're not going to be able to find that out. It's the most important election in our history, right now. Most important election in our history.
 Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we'll end our reliance on China once and for all. Whether it's decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I've been doing already, we're going to end our reliance on China, because we can't rely on China. And I don't want them building a military like they're building right now, and they're using our money to build it.
 We'll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We'll create ""Made in America"" tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States. And we'll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can't do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We'll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. And we'll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.
 Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump. But as long as I'm President, we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole.
 So happy Labor Day, everybody.
 Yes. Go ahead.
 Former Senator John S. McCain III/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's Canceled November 2018 Visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France/News Media 
 Former Senator John S. McCain III/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's Canceled November 2018 Visit to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France/News Media  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. The issue of what happened when you were in France continues to be a story.
 Q.  The President. You're going to have to take that off, please. Just—you can take it off. Your health—how many feet are you away?
 The President. Q. I'll speak a lot louder.
 Q.  The President. Well, if you don't take it off, you're very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.
 The President. Q. Well, I'll just speak a lot louder. Is that better?
 Q.  The President. It's better, yes. It's better.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, some people are having a hard time believing your denials of the Atlantic story because of what you said about John McCain in the past. Do you understand that? And have you asked John Kelly——
 Q.  The President. No, I don't understand that.
 The President. Q. And have you asked John Kelly to refute that story?
 Q.  The President. No, I don't understand it at all, no, because I've always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we're going to win them. And frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that's been very obvious. I was—but I had to approve his entire—his funeral. I wanted him to get—he deserved a first-class—you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket—a lot of things. But no, I was never a fan of John McCain, because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn't. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of—our great vets—was not good, not appropriate. And of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody—am I supposed to say, ""What a wonderful guy""?
 The President. So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it's turned out to be right. But I wasn't a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn't agree with him on a lot of things.
 The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself—which I don't read, but I hear it's just totally anti-Trump; he's a big Obama person, he's a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It's a totally made-up story.
 In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he's—that's—I think that's number 15—and these are people that were there. That's the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it's not true. He just came out.
 And it's a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There's nobody—and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.
 But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn't hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.
 Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I've just about ever seen. And it was a fog you—you literally couldn't see. I walked out, and I didn't have—I didn't need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, ""There's no way we can take helicopters in this."" I understand helicopters very well. And they said, ""No, sir, that's been canceled.""
 They would have had to go—Secret Service, I have the whole list—they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, ""Please don't do it,"" because they're not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.
 I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours. I didn't care. It didn't matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, ""Sir, we can't allow you to make this trip."" If I wanted to: ""Sir, we can't allow you, from a safety standpoint.""
 It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier—the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there'll be more phony stories.
 But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that's denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he's probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that's enough of that.
 Yes, please.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities 
 Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities  Q. Thank you, sir. Christina Bobb, One America News. Thank you for holding the briefing.
 Q.  The President. Thank you.
 The President. Q. We're seeing judges, most recently in Detroit, limit police ability to use nonlethal force. My first question would be: Should the police be allowed to use nonlethal force to quell the violence in their cities?
 Q.  The President. We're talking about where? Nonlethal force?
 The President. Q. Right. So, in the riots, most recently——
 Q.  The President. The riots?
 The President. Q. Yes.
 Q.  The President. Well, I think what's happened is the—the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there's no retribution. There's no—they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen.
 The President. But I've told, when we have the Federal in there—as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a—another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After 2½ days, they didn't arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren't playing games. They can't play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there's got to be a form of retribution.
 I watch—so often, when I watch some of the areas that we're talking about—now we have Rochester—that's, again, Democrat Governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be.
 I was with the Governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, ""I can't imagine how they allow this to happen."" And you know, it's different. It's different. I could talk about other Governors saying the same thing.
 Yes, please, go ahead.
 Removal or Defacement of Monuments, Memorials, and Statues 
 Removal or Defacement of Monuments, Memorials, and Statues  Q. If I could follow up on that. We're also hearing reports of groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter traveling around the country, leaving their home cities to go riot and protest in other cities where they're causing damage.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. Do we expect to see prosecution or charges——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose?
 Q. —— The President. So we have now over a thousand people—Federal—in jail. We're prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was 3 months ago. There hasn't been a Federal monument knocked down in 3 months, or even thought about. I don't think they've even thought about it. So that's had a very big impact—a very big impact.
 The President. But yes, we're going around, and the nice part is, you people take—see those people up there?—they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don't even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it.
 But right after that, I signed an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They've got plenty of ideas. They're not at want for ideas.
 Please, go ahead.
 National Economy/Economic Stimulus Legislation 
 National Economy/Economic Stimulus Legislation  Q. Mr. Spunt—David Spunt from Fox News. Mr. Trump—Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. Sir, you talked a lot about the economy and touted the economy. Three weeks ago, in Bedminster, I asked you specifically why you have not called Democratic leadership in the White House to meet with them. If they don't want to meet, it's on them.
 Q.  A lot of people are criticizing you. I cover you on the weekends and stuff. You're——
 The President. I don't think they are.
 The President. Q. ——doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. I mean, we're in September. There is no deal. There is no hope of a deal.
 Q.  The President. I know. I know.
 The President. Q. We're 2 months out from the election. What do you say to——
 Q.  The President. Don't say there's ""no hope."" Why do you say there's ""no hope""?
 The President. Q. But what can you say to the millions——
 Q.  The President. What do you know?
 The President. Q. Well, what can you say—it doesn't seem——
 Q.  The President. What do you know?
 The President. Q. It doesn't seem like there's hope, sir.
 Q.  The President. And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that's what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don't want to make a deal, because they think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you're dealing with. I do. These are people that I don't have a lot of respect. I don't think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I'm dealing with.
 The President. And I don't need to meet with them to be turned down. They don't want to make a deal, because they know that's good for the economy. And if they make a deal that's good for the economy, and therefore it's good for me for the election in November—November 3—and therefore, they're not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want—they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and States. Whether it's New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we're saying, ""Well, we're not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out."" We'll do something to help cities, but that's going to have to rest on its own.
 And why didn't you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I'm dealing with.
 And I'm on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they're there. But I also know when it's time to meet with people. I've done very well with deals, okay? That's what I do. And I know when it's time to meet. But I don't have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks—which is the microphones—and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office.
 So they don't want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that's good for the Democrats. But, David, that's a bad thing.
 Yes, please. Go ahead.
 Q. But as President, shouldn't you take the high road, sir?
 Q.  The President. I am taking the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road.
 The President. Yes.
 Q. And you——
 Q.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. David——
 Q.  The President. And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I'd do it in a minute.
 The President. Yes. Go ahead.
 2016 Donald J. Trump Presidential Campaign/Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act/Vote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election 
 2016 Donald J. Trump Presidential Campaign/Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act/Vote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election  Q. Yeah, David Jackson, USA Today. My question is about the Durham report, which you have talked about recently. You said, ""Let's see what happens."" Now, you've accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation——
 Q.  The President. Yes. Sure. Sure.
 The President. Q. ——including President Obama and Joe Biden.
 Q.  The President. They spied on my campaign. That's right.
 The President. Q. Because my question is——
 Q.  The President. They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail 2 years ago. They would have been in jail—literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail 2 years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.
 The President. Q. But excuse me, my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this? The President. I'm not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven't seen—I purposely—I don't know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don't know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I'll get involved in it.
 Q.  The President. They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake—written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats—and they used that illegally in the FISA courts.
 If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right—right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents—we don't have that yet, but the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens.
 Q. It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people.
 Q.  The President. But let me just—let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let's see what happens.
 The President. But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least—it would have started 2 years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can't do that. That's never—and nothing like that's ever happened before. Then, they created, at tremendous expense—the money they paid is tremendous; I'm sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier—a fake dossier—proven to be, now, fake. Everyone—and they used it in the FISA courts. That's a crime.
 Q. But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute——
 Q.  The President. So far, I haven't seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens with the Durham report.
 The President. But this started at Obama, and some people would say—and some people, ""Well, but he was President,"" like, ""Let's leave him alone."" If it were me, they wouldn't be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It's a totally double standard, and it's a disgrace.
 And if I were a Republican Senator and if I were a Republican Congressman—and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don't fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot—they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they're dirty fighters.
 And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They're not requested; they're just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, nonrequested. I call them ""unsolicited ballots."" That's going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they're going to say, ""What am I doing?"" And then, they're going to harvest. They're going to do all the things.
 And if you look at the last period of 6 months—take a look at the races where they've sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner, because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what's happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It's a disgrace. That will be a beauty.
 Yes, please.
 U.S. Postal Service Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Louis DeJoy 
 U.S. Postal Service Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Louis DeJoy  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. If proven true, are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that?
 Q.  The President. Yes, I don't know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don't—other than that, I'd have to see it. He's a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of an approval that took place by both parties. I don't know exactly what the story is. I'll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time—I read it this morning, just like you did.
 The President. Q. Would you support an investigation, sir?
 Q.  The President. Sure. Sure.
 The President. Q. And in——
 Q.  The President. I think let the investigations go. But he's a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster General is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we'll see how that goes. But no, I think he's a very honest guy, but we'll see.
 The President. Yes.
 Q. If he's proven to be a campaign——
 Q.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, just a follow-up, please, if you don't mind. If it's proven to be a campaign finance scheme, do you think he should lose his job?
 Q.  The President. Yes. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?
 The President. Q. Thank you.
 Q.  The President. Always. They've been looking at me for 4 years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For 4 years—from the day I came down the escalator, I've been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, ""You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the office of President.""
 The President. Think of it: They spent—just Mueller alone, he spent—I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was—many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every—and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said—sophisticated friends have said, ""You've got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office."" And there's a lot of truth to that.
 Yes, please.
 Nord Stream 2 Natural Gas Pipeline/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Defense Burden-Sharing 
 Nord Stream 2 Natural Gas Pipeline/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Defense Burden-Sharing  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. After Navalny poisoning, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move?
 Q.  The President. Sure.
 The President. Q. Do you think that the project should be canceled? The President. Sure. Well, I've been support—I've been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.
 Q.  The President. When I came along, I said: ""Wait a minute. We're protecting Germany from Russia, right?"" NATO. ""We're protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy."" And the real number is, probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the—what we've done for Ukraine, relative to what the past—they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.
 And I said: ""Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we're protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?"" And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent, because they're only paying a little more than 1 percent and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump—me—I got the countries of NATO to spend one point—$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.
 And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess—and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.
 But I'm the one that did that. So—but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.
 The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don't know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They're closing all their plants. They're closing their nuclear. They're closing their coal. They're closing a lot of plants. And they are—they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.
 Yes, please.
 News Media/Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly 
 News Media/Former Chief of Staff John F. Kelly  Q. Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason's [Jeff Mason, Reuters] question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute the Atlantic? And then, can I ask something else?
 Q.  The President. No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No.
 The President. I was very heartened to see that a friend of his—because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him—I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did—I guess, late last night—that it was not true.
 Office of Management and Budget Guidance on Federal Employee Training Restrictions 
 Office of Management and Budget Guidance on Federal Employee Training Restrictions  Q. Can I ask another question, sir, on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about Federal Government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases?
 Q.  The President. Well, we're going to do a report. Yes, I fired those people; they're all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we're going to give you a big report that's going to make you very happy.
 The President. All right, yes, please.
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development
 Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development Q. Thank you. Darlene Superville, AP. You said a moment ago, ""They'll say anything."" You were talking about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted——
 Q.  The President. No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They're going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it—and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson and Johnson, I spoke to the heads of the greatest medical companies in the world. We're doing great. We're going to have it soon.
 The President. Q. Right——
 Q.  The President. Wait a minute. So now what they're saying is: ""Oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time."" By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for 3 years, and you probably wouldn't have it all.
 The President. So we're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about.
 Q. Yes.
 Q.  The President. But let me just tell you—wait. And what they're doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources—if you have sources—if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you'll see it's going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.
 The President. So now they're saying: ""Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let's disparage the vaccine."" That's so bad for this country. That's so bad for the world to even say that. And that's what they're saying.
 But I watched Kamala's poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn't like her, and I understand why. She will never be President—although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.
 Q. Right, but——
 Q.  The President. But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you're going to have to look at her a little bit too closely.
 The President. But she's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement. I don't want the achievement for myself, I want something that's going to make people better, that people aren't going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we're doing equally as well. Therapeutics.
 Q. May I finish? May I finish the question?
 Q.  The President. Go ahead.
 The President. Q. Your point is that: What they're saying is that they're saying it for a political purposes.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by—before the election, by the end of October.
 Q.  The President. No, I didn't say—I didn't say ""they will."" I said, ""By the end of the year.""
 The President. Q. Aren't you doing the same thing that you——
 Q.  The President. No, but you're not quoting me accurately.
 The President. Q. ——say they're guilty of?
 Q.  The President. I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market—they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else.
 The President. You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we're going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.
 So I didn't say what you said. What I said is ""by the end of the year."" But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.
 Q. But aren't you also saying that for political reasons?
 Q.  The President. No, I'm saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast—with me, it's the faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I'm saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have—if get the vaccine early, that's a great thing, whether it's politics or not.
 The President. Now, do benefits inure if you're able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it's the most important thing.
 Yes, go ahead. In the back.
 1619 Project/Washington Monument 
 1619 Project/Washington Monument  Q. Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets, sir, do you——
 Q.  The President. You sound so clear—[laughter]—as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.
 The President. laughter Q. Your tweets about the 1619 Project——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. ——why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools?
 Q.  The President. Yes, so—no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I'm not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don't study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately.
 The President. But we grew up with a certain history, and now they're trying to change our history—revisionist history. That's why they want to take down our monuments. That's why they want to take down our statues.
 I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it—the DC committee, but the DC committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson—I mean, we're talking about—this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to redesignate it. They want to take some down. No, we don't do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that.
 Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we're having tremendous success, whether it's on the vaccines, whether it's on the pandemic—the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen, because I will never feel the same about China.
 Q. Can I ask a question on the vaccine?
 Q. The President. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day.
 The President.  Thank you very much, everybody.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1260"
"28","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 10, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much. Wow. We have some big ones today, huh? This is a room, all loaded up. Wow. Paula Reid [CBS News]. Jonathan Karl [ABC News]. Phil Rucker [Washington Post]. Hi, Phil. How are you? Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN]. We've got the all-stars. A lot of all-stars today. You too.
 The President. Q. Alex Alper, Reuters.
 Q.  The President. You too. That's good. Well, that's fine.
 The President. Thank you very much. In the past 4 months, we've added 10.6 million jobs, including 643 [thousand]* manufacturing jobs and 658,000 construction jobs. It's far beyond expectations.
 We've experienced the smallest contraction of any western nation, meaning we've been affected less than any other Nation—western nation—and probably, almost, I think you can put us in—I just saw some numbers—I think you can put us into just about any category anywhere. And the fastest recovery by far. And that's anywhere. Nobody has recovered like we're recovering.
 If we followed Joe Biden's strategy, we'd shut down the entire country after just having set records on growth. And we also did have tremendous retail growth, as you probably noticed. We're witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in our history. By contrast, the Obama-Biden administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history, as you know.
 We continue to make progress in our fight against the China virus. New weekly cases have declined by 44 percent since July. Deaths declined by 20 percent compared to just last week. It's going down very rapidly. Really rapidly. This is in contrast to nations in the European Union, which have recently experienced a sharp increase in cases. They're having a very big spike over there. We're, hopefully, beyond our spike, and we'll see, but we're doing very well all over our country.
 In the past 5 weeks, per capita cases doubled in France; surged to over 300 percent in Spain, which I've been hearing about and speaking to some of the leaders of Spain, and they are having a hard time; and increased more than 400 percent in Italy again. And as you remember, I stopped—I put a ban on people coming in from Europe after the ban I imposed on China, Wuhan—but because of Wuhan primarily, because that area was very infected. We also put a ban on Europe. So Spain is being heavily impacted, France, and 400 percent in Italy.
 Yesterday European nations experienced 50-percent more deaths than the United States. And you don't hear these things. You don't hear these statistics. But the United States has done really well. Very proud of everybody that worked on this. And I really do believe we're rounding the corner.
 And the vaccines are right there, but even—not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner. We already have therapeutics out there, by the way, which are having obviously a very big impact, because you look at that, you look at the way people are recovering, it's so much better than in the past before we knew about the disease and had anything to fight the disease. On schools, as part of our science-based approach, we want schools to safely open and stay open. Children are at extremely low risk of complications from the virus. Less than 0.2 percent—0.2 percent of the coronavirus deaths have occurred in those under the age of 25, and most had underlying conditions where there was a problem.
 There is no substitute for in-person learning. According to a recent study, student progress in math decreased by half and—using online education compared to in-person or campus education. So, online, we think of so many things online and how great it is; there's nothing like being in the classroom. That's what we've learned from this whole ordeal.
 According to the CDC, school closures disproportionately harm low-income and minority children, as well as those with disabilities. And I think you see some slides behind me that are very new, very current. It's also crucial for colleges and universities to stay open. And we hope that they do indeed stay open, and we want to see Big 10 football. We hope it's coming back. We have a lot of the colleges that we're talking about, they want to come back. We hope that Michigan agrees.
 We hope that—and I know the Governor will have a lot to say about it. We hope she approves it. But we have a couple that—Maryland is another one. We hope the Governor puts a little pressure on so that we can have it, but I have a feeling they may do it. They may do it without having everybody, but I think they're going to have maybe Michigan, maybe Maryland. We have a couple of States that might not participate.
 But people are working very, very hard to get Big 10 football back, and I'm pushing it. And it will be a great thing for our country and the players. And the coaches want to do it really badly. The players are missing—they only have so many years of this. And the players are missing a big opportunity, including the chance, in some of the cases—they have some of the best players, college players in our country, and they want to get into the NFL, and they want to make money in the NFL, and they're not going to be able to do that too easy if you don't get to see them play.
 It's much safer for students to live on campus—and low-risk young people would—rather than the alternative. It's—the alternative is no good—than going home spreading the virus to high-risk Americans. It's—they want to be on campus. They want to go back to school. And the parents want them back in school, maybe more so than they want to be back in school. And they want them back safely, and they want to go back safely, but they have to go back.
 Based on the recent data from more than 20 colleges, not a single student who tested positive for the virus has been hospitalized. So that's a lot of people. That's a lot of students. Not one has been hospitalized.
 As we continue to follow the science-based approach to protect our people and vanquish the virus, Joe Biden continues to use the pandemic for political gain. Every time I see him, he starts talking about the pandemic. He's reading it off a teleprompter. I'm not allowed to use a teleprompter. Why is that, Phil? They ask questions, and he starts reading the teleprompter. He says, ""Move the teleprompter a little bit closer, please."" I don't know, I think if I did that, I'd be in big trouble. I think that would be the story of the year.
 When I took early action in January to ban the travel and all travel to and from China, the Democrats and Biden, in particular, called it ""xenophobic."" You remember that? Joe was willing to sacrifice American lives to placate the radical-left, open-border extremists. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, probably hundreds of thousands of lives. And we saved millions of lives by doing the closing—and now the opening—the way we did it.
 Joe's decision to publicly attack the China ban proved he lacks the character or intelligence or instinct to do what is right. Now Biden has launched a public campaign against the vaccine, which is so bad, because we have some vaccines coming that are incredible. Scott was telling me about some of the things that are happening, and it's very exciting, Scott. Thank you for being here. But you don't want to have anything having to do with, for political purposes, being an antivaxxer. You don't want to be talking about the vaccines in a negative way, especially when you see the statistics that we're starting to see. They're incredible, actually.
 Biden is perfectly happy to endanger the lives of other people by doing something that he thinks is going to help him politically, because his polls are getting very bad. They're getting very shaky. This was an election that was going to be very easy, very quick, and then the China virus came in, and I had to go back to work politically, unfortunately. I had to devote more time politically than to the other things we do, which are very important for our country. But I had to go back to work. And it looks like we're going up very rapidly, more rapidly than the media wants to admit.
 And Biden has had to go out. He's gotten out of his basement, and he's working. Let's see what happens. But we've got to talk about how great these vaccines are if, in fact, they're great. And I think you're going to see numbers that are going to be very, very impressive.
 The approach to the virus is a very unscientific blanket lockdown by the Democrats—that's what they're talking about—which takes all of these incredible statistics, records, and it throws them out the window. Now, they did say it would be based on the recommendation of the experts, but you know, whether expert or not, we're not doing any more shutdowns. We did the shutdown, and now we're doing the opening, and there won't be any more shutdowns.
 There could be a little section, a small section, where you have a breakout, but we're not talking about shutdowns like they were talking about, depending on experts. We're not going to be doing that.
 The swine flu was a disaster, you remember, when—not nearly as deadly, not—not the same world. But when Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous. He called it N1H1; it's actually H1N1. You know, you remember the ""H"" comes before the ""N,"" so it's sort of easy to remember, right? But Joe always calls it the opposite way, but it was—call it the ""swine flu."" It was disastrous.
 And his own Chief of Staff said that when Biden helped manage the swine flu in 2009, they, quote, ""did everything possible wrong."" And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. This is a quote from his Chief of Staff. And it's just ""purely a fortuity that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right because we did everything wrong."" It was a disaster. It was a disaster. And now he's telling us how to manage—he can't manage himself.
 Two hundred and seventy thousand Americans were hospitalized during this attack. The outbreak was so rampant that the Obama administration told States to stop testing. ""We don't want any tests,"" because they don't want to show all of the things that tests show. By the way, we're setting a record on testing. Our testing is at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We're substantially greater than the second country—which is India, by the way, which has 1.5 billion people. But we're 50 million tests ahead—50 million ahead.
 And they ordered the CDC to stop counting tests and stop counting cases and then left us a depleted stockpile, which is what I inherited. I inherited a depleted—a very badly depleted—stockpile. In other words, Biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge of this very serious, highly, highly contagious epidemic or pandemic—the China virus—countless more Americans would have died. And if we didn't do what we did—and I say it all the time now, because the media likes to belittle. What we've done has been incredible. Now you can look at Europe and you can look at other places, and you can start comparing.
 Biden is weak on China. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund—partly owned by Joe Biden's son Hunter—facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor. You don't want to write about that, do you? Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China. Now the Biden family is selling out our country directly to the Chinese military, which has to do with this company that Hunter—here we go with Hunter again. He didn't have a job; now, all of a sudden, he's selling companies from Michigan to China.
 China's military got American manufacturing jobs, and the Biden family got paid a lot of money. And I say it, ""If Joe Biden ever got elected, China will own America."" He will—they will own America.
 Finally, I can announce with great pride that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be departing this evening on a historic trip to Doha—that's Qatar—for the beginning of intra-Afghan peace negotiations. We've been negotiating with them for quite some time, getting along with them, moved a lot of soldiers out.
 I got a report this morning that there's been nobody killed in Afghanistan since early February. It's a long time. There's been no deaths, no problems. And a lot of progress is being made in Afghanistan. But we'll be down to 4,000 soldiers in a very short period of time.
 Likewise, Iraq: We'll be down to about 2,000 soldiers in a very short period of time. And, in Syria, for the most part, we're out, other than we kept the oil. And so we have soldiers guarding the oil—not too many; I think a small number—but they're guarding the oil. And we're helping the Kurds, and we're making their lives much more pleasant, because of the fact that we have the oil.
 So we're pretty much out of Syria. We're pretty much out of Iraq. And we're down to the smallest force that we've had in—we'll be very shortly down to that number in Afghanistan.
 The negotiations are a result of a bold diplomatic effort on part of my administration in recent months and years. The United States will play an important role in bringing the parties together to end the decades-long war; it's been going on for almost 20 years, long before I got involved, I can tell you that.
 And had they not been wasting our time with all of the phony witch hunts and all of the things, we probably could have done this even faster. But a lot of time had to be spent wasted like that. But the parties are together right now, and we're negotiating, and we're really making tremendous progress.
 Next week at the White House, we'll be having a signing between U.A.E. and Israel, and we could have another country added into that. And I will tell you, countries are lining up that want to go into it.
 As you know, U.A.E. is headed by a very, very highly respected gentleman and respected by everybody. And he's a warrior too. He's a great warrior. And Mohammed is very excited about this. And you'll be hearing other countries coming in over a relatively short period of time.
 And you could have peace in the Middle East. I think what, ultimately, will happen is, you're going to have quite a few countries come in. The big ones are going to be coming in. I spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia, so we're talking. We're starting a—we just started the dialogue. And you'll have them come in. And I think two things are going to happen: Iran will—if we win the election, Iran will come and sign a deal with us very, very rapidly, within the first, I would say, week, but let's give ourselves a month—because their GDP went down 25 percent, which is, like, an unheard of number, and they'd like to be able to get back to having a successful country again. So I think that'll happen.
 And I think, very importantly, the Palestinians will get back into the fold. And when they see all of these countries that, frankly, have been supporters of the Palestinians—very big supporters and, certainly, financial supporters.
 As you know, we used to pay the Palestinians $750 million a year, and I ended that some time ago, on the basis that they didn't seem to want to make peace. And we'll think about it once we have a deal, but I've ended that quite a while ago. I'm frankly surprised they haven't been to the table earlier.
 But this is the best way. This is a way that's going to be great. This can really bring the Middle East together.
 And again, since February, we haven't had a death in Afghanistan, which is—it's a record for many years. Not a death. And we're getting along very, very well with the Taliban and very well with Afghanistan and its representatives. And we'll see how it all goes. It's a negotiation.
 But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be departing in a little while. So I think that's very exciting news. And a lot of people thought that my natural instinct is war; no, my natural instinct is actually peace. When we were on the debate stage, people used to say, ""Will it be 1 week or 2 weeks before President Trump gets into a war?"" But that's not—I did rebuild our military. We have a military that—2½ trillion dollars—new jets and rockets and tanks and ships and a lot of things we have. We have the newest, best military we've ever had. So, hopefully, we won't have to use it.
 Our nuclear program has been put into gear like never before, and in particular, hopefully, we won't have to use that, because that's a whole new level of destruction. And we never want to—just have to pray to God we never have to use that.
 All right, please, Jon.
 The President's Knowledge of the Coronavirus Pandemic/Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Coronavirus Mortality Rates 
 The President's Knowledge of the Coronavirus Pandemic/Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Coronavirus Mortality Rates  Q. Yes, thank you, Mr. President. Why did you lie to the American people? And why should we trust what you have to say now?
 Q.  The President. Such a terrible question and the phraseology. I didn't lie. What I said is: We have to be calm; we can't be panicked. I knew that the tapes were there. These were a series of phone calls that we had—mostly phone calls. And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect, just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.
 The President. But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls. So we did that. I don't know if it's good or bad. I don't even know if the book is good or bad, but certainly, if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it, because he thinks that—you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact. And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was bad. Nobody thought it was bad.
 Q. But when you told him that this——
 Q.  The President. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. And your question—the way you phrased that is such a disgrace. It's a disgrace to ABC television network. It's a disgrace to your employer. And that's the answer. Are you ready? Because I——
 The President. Q. Are you saying you didn't lie?
 Q.  The President. I love——
 The President. Q. I mean, you told him that you knew that——
 Q.  The President. Of course, I didn't. Of course, I didn't.
 The President. Q. ——it was ""deadlier than the flu.""
 Q.  The President. No, no. No, no.
 The President. Q. And then, you went out and told the American public that this was ""just like the flu.""
 Q.  The President. Let me tell you something: We've had flu years——
 The President. Q. I mean, you told Woodward one thing and you told everybody else something else.
 Q.  The President. No. And five times, right? Five times. You ever hear the expression, ""five times""? We've had flu years where we lost 100,000 people. The flu is a very serious problem for this country also. And we've been losing them—Scott, what kind of a number have we lost over the years with flus? Into the hundreds of thousands?
 The President. White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Well, I mean, the last 5 years have been something like 35- to 80,000 per year, every year, even with antiviral drugs and even with vaccines.
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. The President. Flu is a very serious problem also.
 The President. Q. But you told Bob Woodward this is—this is worse than the most deadly—""deadlier than the most strenuous flu.""
 Q.  The President. Okay.
 The President. Q. And then, you went out and said, ""It's just like the flu.""
 Q.  The President. What I went out and said is very simple——
 The President. Q. And that it was ""going to go away.""
 Q.  The President. Listen, what I went out and said is very simple: I want to show a level of confidence, and I want a show strength as a leader, and I want to show that our country is going to be fine, one way or the other. Whether we lose one person—we shouldn't lose any, because this shouldn't have happened. This is China's fault. This is nobody's fault but China. China should not have allowed it to happen.
 The President. Whether you have a—one person, 180,000 people, or 2½ or 3 million people, which it could have been very seriously if we didn't make the moves. And when you look at the opposition, where they said, ""Oh, why did he put the ban on?""—Doctor Fauci said we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by putting the ban on China and then, ultimately, putting the ban on Europe. There was no lie here.
 What we're doing is we're leading, and we're leading in a proper way. And if, frankly, somebody else was leading it, they wouldn't have closed it.
 If you look at Nancy Pelosi, you look at Cuomo, you look at de Blasio, you look at Biden, months later, they said there's no problem—they're talking about me. Months later. And before any statement was made—you have to remember, I put the ban on China. So, obviously, outwardly, I said it's a very serious problem. And it's always a serious problem. That doesn't mean I'm going to jump up and down in the air and start saying: ""People are going to die! People are going to die!"" No. No. I'm not going to do that.
 We're going to get through this. And we're, right now, I hope—really think we're going to—we're rounding the final turn. And a lot of good things are happening with vaccines and with therapeutics, but there's no lying. And the way you ask that question is very disgraceful.
 Q. But should people trust you now?
 Q.  The President. Phil, go ahead, please. Go ahead.
 The President. Yes, I do think so. And I think we did a great job. I think we did a great job. And the people that did such—our generals, our admirals, Mike Pence, all of the people that have worked so hard—and now Dr. Atlas—all of the—Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx—they should be respected for the job they've done.
 Q. So you won't downplay it again?
 Q.  The President. And you haven't——
 The President. Q. You won't downplay it again? Because you said you downplayed it. That's what you told Woodward.
 Q.  The President. All I'm doing is—no, I don't want to jump up and down and start screaming ""Death! Death!"" because that's not what it's about. We have to lead a country. We're leading a great country, and we're doing a great job.
 The President. And the people that have done such a good job should be given the kind of credit that they deserve. We possibly have done the best jobs when you start looking at what we're doing with the vaccines and therapeutics and ventilators. We had no ventilators, Jon. We make thousands of ventilators now a month, and we're supplying them to the whole world. The job we've done is the best job. And don't give me any credit; give the people that have done this the credit. They've done a great job.
 Yes, Phil. Go ahead.
 Global Coronavirus Pandemic/Federal Coronavirus Response 
 Global Coronavirus Pandemic/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Yes, Mr. President, you talked about the need to stay calm and not jump up and down and scare people. A lot of other world leaders were calm. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was very calm and she presented information to the German people so that they could stay safe and protect their families. So why as you, as President of the United States, did you not level with the American people, did you not share the information that you knew at the time, in real time?
 Q.  The President. Well, I don't know what—what Angela is doing. But if you look at the European Union right now, they're having breakouts like you've never seen before. And, frankly, their numbers are at a level that are much worse than the numbers here.
 The President. Q. Many people have died in the United States.
 Q.  The President. We are—we have done—we have—Phil, we have done much, much better than the European Union. I just read you numbers that are not good on their behalf; that are very good at ours. And we have rounded the final turn, and we have—we're going to have vaccines very soon——
 The President. Q. Sir, that's just not true. That's just not true.
 Q.  The President. ——maybe much sooner than you think. Listen, maybe much sooner than you think. But we have done a phenomenal job, and the people that have done this job—including the American public that's had to put up with a lot with the lockdowns and all of the things that they had to do—they have to be given credit. They have to be given credit.
 The President.  Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Transmissibility of Coronavirus/Coronavirus Outbreak in China 
 Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Transmissibility of Coronavirus/Coronavirus Outbreak in China  Q. But you knew this was a deadly virus.
 Q.  The President. Please, go ahead.
 The President. Q. You knew it was airborne. You knew—on February 7, you told Bob Woodward how it transferred from person to person in the air, how deadly it was. Why did you not come to the podium and calmly tell the people what to expect?
 Q.  The President. Well, let me ask you this: If Bob Woodward thought that was bad—because this is stuff that everyone knew. There's a report that I have here someplace where China said it was airborne earlier than the statements I made. People knew it was airborne. This was nothing—this was no big—when I say it was airborne, everybody knew it was airborne. This was no big thing.
 The President. Q. [Inaudible]—put that out in February?
 Q.  Inaudible The President. But read the reports. China came out with a statement that it was an airborne disease. I heard it was an airborne disease. I assumed it early on. The fact is, there has to be a calmness. You don't want me jumping up and down, screaming: ""There's going to be great death. There is going""—and really causing some very, very serious problems for the country.
 The President. If Bob Woodward thought what I said was bad, then he should have immediately, right after I said it, gone out to the authorities so they can prepare and let them know.
 Q. But Bob Woodward is not——
 Q.  The President. But he didn't think it was bad, and he said he didn't think it was bad. He actually said he didn't think it was bad.
 The President. Q. Bob Woodward is not the President.
 Q.  The President. The only one that said it was bad or thinks it was bad were the fake news media, because they take it and they try and put it a certain way.
 The President. If Bob Woodward thought it was bad, then he should have immediately gone out publicly, not wait 4 months. You know, he's had that statement for 4 months, maybe 5 months. He's had it for a long time. It was a series of taped interviews, mostly by telephone—quick ones, not long ones. Quick ones. And it was—I did it out of curiosity, because I do have respect, and I want to see—I wonder whether or not somebody like that can write good. I don't think he can, but let's see what happens.
 Q. Respectfully——
 Q. The President. Yes, please.
 The President.  Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election 
 Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. We're just about 50 days out from the election, and we haven't seen a lot out of the Durham investigation yet.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. Where is that? And do you have confidence in the investigation?
 Q.  The President. Well, I can't tell you that yet. I have to see. I'm not involved in it. I purposely stayed uninvolved. I'm, I guess, considered the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I could be involved if I wanted to. I thought it would be better if I wasn't. I think it's better if our great Attorney General handle it. He has Durham, who is a very, very respected man, and we're going to see what it is. I can't tell you that.
 The President. Q. But do you want to see more indictments?
 Q.  The President. I can tell you this—I can tell you this: They lied, they cheated, they leaked, they got caught. They spied on my campaign. Never in history has there been anything like this. And I guarantee if the roles were reversed and I was on the Democrat side, people would have been in jail at the very highest level. People would have been in jail for 2 years already. Nothing like this has ever happened. And the term would be for many, many years, because it's treason, and other words can be used also.
 The President. Q. So you think there should be more indictments as a part of this investigation?
 Q.  The President. Well, I think—just on what I read in your wonderful papers, I think—and see what, you know, just looking at the media—not even what I know. I think Comey is a disgrace to our country. I think Strzok—who just wrote a book, which is a total fake—is a disgrace. I think Page—Lisa Page, his lover—is a disgrace to our country. I think that when you look at McCabe, where his wife got $700,000 in campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton—right?
 The President. And then Hillary Clinton is under investigation, and yet she paid the head of the FBI—one of the top people, but actually the head, because he took over for the other guy, who fortunately I fired. I made a good move when I fired. That was a smart move, because they were looking to take down this administration, duly elected administration. So I fired him. That was a great move when I fired him. Because maybe, if I didn't, I wouldn't be here talking to you as President.
 But when McCabe's wife gets $700,000 in campaign contributions when she was running for whatever office she was running from—from Virginia—and yet he's in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now, he says, ""Well, I wasn't really in charge."" Of course, he was in charge. He was totally in charge. He knew exactly what was going on.
 These people got caught in the—probably the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught.
 Now, what the Durham report is going to say, I can't tell you. But if they say half as much as I already know—just from seeing it. You know, you have people—I watch some of the shows. I watch Liz McDonald; she's fantastic. I watched Fox Business. I watched Lou Dobbs last night, Sean Hannity last night, Tucker last night, Laura. I watched ""Fox and Friends"" in the morning. You watch these shows; you don't have to go too far into the details. They cover things that are—it's really an amazing thing.
 They got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They were spying on their opponent's campaign. Not only spying; they were making up fake dossiers. You have the dirty dossier. They were making up the dirty—and it was all made up. It was all fiction. It turned out to be fiction. And then, they were using that in the FISA courts—this revered court. Well, it's not so revered anymore, because when you look at what they did and how they played it—and they hurt a lot of people.
 General Flynn is still being hurt, and he's being hurt very badly. He's a wonderful person. I spoke to General Milley about General Flynn 2 weeks ago. I said, ""What do you think of General Flynn?"" He said: ""He's a great soldier, sir. And he's a wonderful, wonderful human being."" He's been destroyed. He's been destroyed. No, I think that this—without knowing anything about what Durham is going to release—the ""Durham report,"" we'll call it, or maybe it's going to be more than a report. Maybe it's going to be much more than a report, I don't know. Maybe it's a report or maybe it's much more than that.
 But when I look at the—the things that everybody in this room knows, just from reading about it from yourselves back and forth, I think it's a disgrace to our country. And I think if people don't pay a very, very substantial price, it will happen again. And this should never ever happen to another President.
 Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. Q. [Inaudible]
 Q. Inaudible Q. Will you still mislead the American people, Mr. President?
 Q. Q. You understand that your saying it's airborne is different than China saying it's airborne?
 Q.  Q. Where is your health care plan, Mr. President?
 Q. Q. Mr. President, please take more questions. [Laughter] Q Laughter","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1261"
"29","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 16, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Good afternoon. Hurricane Sally made landfall, as you know, in Alabama and Florida last night as a category 2 hurricane, and has caused 35 inches of rainfall in some places. That's a lot.
 The President. We have hundreds of FEMA, Coast Guard; we have the National Guard personnel on the ground assisting response to the efforts. And Alabama is in great shape, and every place that we are working with the State governments—really in great shape. We are working very hard on that.
 But it looks like it's going to be mostly safe, but just follow the instructions of all of your local and Federal people there. We have the best people that you can have. So I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everybody for working so hard in Florida. And they're very good at this. The people in Florida handle it; they know how to handle it. And the people working there know how to handle it.
 The Governors have all been spoken to, and it's a combination of real spirit. And they have a tremendous esprit de corps. They have a tremendous sense of working on hurricanes; they've gotten very good at it. And we've certainly had plenty, even since I've been here. We've had a lot of them. So that's in good shape—Hurricane Sally.
 We're going to talk about Big Ten football, but that's a terrific thing. We'll discuss that at the end. I just want to go into the vaccine distribution.
 Today my administration released our detailed national vaccine distribution plan, and that includes a plan to ensure that we swiftly deliver the vaccine directly to America's senior citizens in nursing homes. And it's all set. We have our military lined up. Everybody is lined up. And we think that's going to go very nicely. We're very close to that vaccine, as you know, and I think closer than most people want to say or certainly closer than most people understand.
 To get the vaccine into the hands of American people, we're fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military. This is the largest, fastest, and most advanced vaccine distribution effort in American history, by far. I was reading where Biden was saying that, oh, he's going to have a plan. They did so bad on swine flu, you wouldn't even believe it. Take a look at their record on swine flu. In fact, the person that headed it up said it was a total disaster.
 We're on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we'll be able to start. That will be from mid-October on. It may be a little bit later than that, but we'll be all set.
 So as soon as it's given the go-ahead—and they're doing trials, as you know—and as soon as it's given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus. We've manufactured all of the necessary supplies so that as soon as the FDA approves the vaccine—and, as you know, we're very close to that—we'll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that.
 I'm calling on Biden to stop promoting his antivaccine theories, because all they're doing is hurting the importance of what we're doing. And I know that if they were in this position, they'd be saying how wonderful it is. They're recklessly endangering lives. You can't do that. And again, this is really a case that they're only talking—just started talking a little bit negatively, and that's only because they know we have it, or we will soon have it. And the answer to that is very soon.
 The case updates—it's very interesting to see what's happening because the test positivity rate is down among all age groups and has fallen below 5 percent for the first time since this whole nightmare of the China virus began. So it's fallen below 5 percent.
 The number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 43 percent from mid-July—43 percent. Nationally, people sick with the China virus now make up only 1.5 percent of all emergency room visits. So we're down to the lowest number we've had—1.5 percent of emergency room visits is for the China virus.
 And thanks to our lifesaving therapies and treatments—I think this is the best of all, in terms of our great percentages and all the progress we've made—the fatality rate has fallen 85 percent since April—85 percent—fatality rate.
 If you look at what we've done and all of the lives that we've saved—and I'm going to ask that a graph be put up, and now it's up. This was right at the beginning. This was our prediction that if we do a really good job, we'll be at about a hundred and—100,000 to 240,000 deaths. And we're below that substantially, and we'll see what comes out. But that would be if we did the good job. If the not-so-good job was done, you'd be between 1.5 million—I remember these numbers so well—and 2.2 million. That's quite a difference.
 So we're down in this territory. And that's despite the fact that the blue States had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue States out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the States, they were blue States and blue-State-managed.
 And by the way, we'd recommend they open up their States. I think it's very important that they open up their States, because if you look at certain of them—North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others—we have to get those States open. It's hurting people. It's hurting people far more than the disease itself.
 So we would recommend that you open them; let your people have freedom. And it's unfair to your people to keep them closed at this stage. We know the vaccine—we know the vaccines are coming, but we know the problem; we understand who the vulnerable are, which is primarily people with medical problems, but in particular, people with medical problems that are older. So open up your states.
 To facilitate routine testing of the nursing home residents and staff, we've delivered rapid testing devices to all 1,000—or, excuse me, 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide. So you have 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide, and they are being facilitated in terms of testing and testing apparatus. Everything is there.
 We also have new tests coming, and we have one in particular that I think I showed last night, which is literally two pieces of very fine cardboard. It's actually a lot of delicate things going on inside that cardboard, but it's an incredible test. It's very quick, it's very accurate, and moves along rapidly. We bought millions of those tests, and they're going to be distributed rapidly.
 So the testing process, where—there's nobody in the world that has a testing process like ours. In addition to being a number one—number two, which is India, is close to 50 million tests behind us, I believe, Scott. Fifty million. They have 1.5 billion people. Tomorrow Vice President Pence will be announcing the findings of the Nursing Home Commission to continue protecting our most vulnerable, which is our senior citizens. And we're going to take good care of them.
 I want to congratulate Big Ten football. It's going—it's back. And I want to, in particular—I've been dealing with him—thank Commissioner Kevin Warren for the great job he did. We've been working with him for a while. There was a rumor being spread that I didn't want football back, and it was just the opposite. That was another disinformation rumor put out by the Biden campaign. And it was just the opposite. But it really spurred me into action.
 I called the commissioner a couple of weeks ago, and we started really putting a lot of pressure on, frankly, because there was no reason for it not to come back. And Kevin went in and worked very hard. I want to thank the players, the coaches for working along. And they wanted it very badly—the players and coaches, in particular; the parents also. And Big Ten football just announced, as you know, that their schedule—they announced a schedule, and it's going to be great; important to have.
 I want to recommend that the Pac-12 also get going, because there's no reason why Pac-12 shouldn't be playing now. And perhaps, they'll start with—at least partially—I had recommended today to Kevin and others that maybe you want to start off with 25 percent of the stadium, or you maybe want to start off with empty. I don't know. If it's—I think they could have fans go, frankly. But they want to be careful, they want to be safe, and they will be safe. They've got a very good testing process for the players, coaches, families, et cetera.
 And so I just want to congratulate Big Ten. It's going to be great. We're going to love watching that. And again, I want to recommend Pac-12—you're the only one now. Open up. Open up, Pac-12. Get going. Said the same thing to Big Ten, and they did, and now I'm saying it to Pac-12. You have time. You really have time right now. Get going.
 I want to thank all of those wonderful coaches, some of whom I spoke with. And we went through a process over the last couple of weeks. And I want to thank Congressman Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who, as you know, was a great football player. Some people know that; I know that. But Anthony was a great player, great receiver. Went to the NFL.
 Also, I want to thank Tim Pataki of my staff. He worked very hard on this. And he was up day and night, working with Kevin and everybody else. So I want to thank Tim Pataki. Great job.
 So Big Ten is back, and it's going to have, hopefully, a great season.
 The Census recently found that in the second quarter of 2020, Hispanic Americans' homeownership reached a record alltime high. That's alltime in the history of our country. Yesterday the Census reported that median income for Americans increased by an unprecedented $4,400 last year to a record of $68,700.
 In 2019, income inequality fell for the second straight year. The income gap widened under the Obama-Biden administration, and it widened fairly substantially, and it narrowed under the Trump administration. So there's a little fact that you didn't know. So it narrowed under us, and it widened under Obama. Income grew more, last year alone, than over the entire 8 years of Obama-Biden. And that's a big statement, but that's the way it is.
 In 2019, 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. That's the largest poverty reduction under any President in history: 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. The Hispanic American poverty rate reached the lowest level ever—history of our country. Hispanic American poverty rate—lowest level ever.
 I created the greatest and fairest economy in history. The biggest gains went to lower income Americans, as they measure that kind of thing. We will be back to full strength very soon. We're going to have a fantastic year next year. It's looking like that. I think you're going to have an incredible third quarter. The numbers are looking very, very strong for the third quarter. We have numbers that we're going to put out tomorrow—some of the individual things: car production, housing production, housing ownership—so many different things are just at levels that nobody thought possible as we round the turn on the pandemic.
 The antipolice crusade from the Democrats and the radical left—and radical-left Democrats also—has to stop. The left-wing war on cops puts our officers in danger and our communities at very grave risk. Can't do this.
 Biden described the police as ""the enemy."" They're not the enemy; they're the friend. They're our friend. They're helping us. And if you go to—I just saw a poll—it just came out or recently came out—where African Americans, by 84 percent, wanted more police. They wanted safe neighborhoods.
 In Phoenix last night, a Federal officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. In L.A. this weekend—everybody saw that—this horrible human being—or whatever you might want to call him—I think ""him."" They're looking all over. There trying to find him. We're going to find out. We're going to get him.
 But in L.A. this weekend, two sheriff's deputies were ambushed and viciously shot, and they can never be the same. They're getting better, but they can never be the same. I'll always stand by our heroes of law enforcement, and we want to stop this horrible rhetoric and stop it fast.
 I want to ask Scott Atlas to say a couple of words, because I heard Biden talking today about, ""He wants to come up with a distribution plan."" A distribution—for the vaccine that we came up with.
 A couple of things: We came up with that vaccine—it will be announced fairly soon—but regardless, this month, next month—in a level of time that nobody thought was possible because of what we did with our FDA in terms of streamlining it. I want to thank Dr. Hahn.
 But what we've done with the streamlining has been incredible, and very safely. Number one is safety. Number two is speed. But you can have perfect safety and have much more speed, and that's what we did.
 We did this for more than the vaccine, having to do with the China virus. This was also for other things. So many other great drugs are out there that would take 10, 12 years to get them approved, and we've moved those schedules up a lot.
 But if this were Obama-Biden, this would have taken 2, 3 years before you were at a stage where we are now at. So we're going to be very soon. And it's sort of funny to watch Joe Biden getting up and reading a teleprompter and saying how he would have done this. They had H1N1. He calls it the ""N1H1""; it's H1N1. It's called the swine flu, and it was a disaster.
 And, as I said, the person that ran it for him said the worst things about it. I mean, just—they didn't know what they were doing, they quit. They had no clue. And that was easy, by comparison to this. This is the most contagious—contagious flu or virus that anybody has seen. This is unbelievable how contagious it is. You found that out.
 But I watched Biden quickly as he discussed, without having—without knowing a thing about a distribution plan. And he said that we don't have a distribution plan, but we do indeed. Our military—we have military, we have everybody involved. It's a great plan, and it's a plan like no other.
 And we can start doing it, I believe, the day that we come up with the vaccine. When it's done, we'll start. That same day, or the day after. Our military is very much involved, and they deploy troops, they deploy—these are the generals that do logistics and all of those things. And we'll have it all over the county, and then, ultimately, hopefully, we'll helping the world with the vaccine. And it's very exciting.
 But maybe I'd ask Scott Atlas to come up and describe a little bit about that and the distribution plan, in particular, because Biden acted as though there was no distribution plan, and we've been working on this for months, and it's ready. And Scott has really taken a hold of it and done an incredible job.
 And please, Scott. Thank you.
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. The President. Thank you.
 The President. Pandemic Adviser Atlas. And I didn't develop the plan, I'm just relaying information here. And—but this is a plan that's a 57-page document that was sent to every State today, and there is a different part of this that was given to Congress today. It was released by HHS. It's on the website. And, in fact, I thought it was covered actually by the media, so I don't think it's a surprise, but it's a comprehensive plan. It's a public-private partnership to get everything done in terms of logistics.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. The IT that's necessary to trace the first dose—because some of these vaccines are anticipated to be two doses—there is tailoring, of course, by the States, and there are specifics. And there's an administration of the vaccine plan that will be done in over 51,000 outlets, including for—particular attention to minority areas, over 14,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers.
 And as the President just said, within the first 24 hours of FDA's approval under an emergency use, we will have vaccines being delivered within the first 24 hours, and it will be done at virtually no cost to Americans.
 And the terms of the dosage: There will be—is it anticipated that no later than January, all the top priority people will have received the vaccine or be able to receive the vaccine. And so that kind of prioritization, which is the general prioritization done for all vaccines that are developed, particularly in a pandemic setting, goes to the high-risk people, the people with other underlying conditions, as well as first responders and people working directly in healthcare. And so that's going to be done very rapidly.
 Okay.
 The President. Good, thank you.
 The President. Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Thank you.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. The President. Thank you very much. Thank you.
 The President. Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Yes. Go ahead.
 The President. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution  Q. Mr. President, earlier today Dr. Redfield confirmed that it looked like November, December the first doses would be able to be distributed. But then, he said that the vaccine for the general public likely would not be available until probably next summer, maybe even early fall. Are you comfortable with that timeline?
 Q.  The President. No, I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information. And I called him, and he didn't tell me that, and I think he got the message maybe confused. Maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we're ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced, and it could be announced in October. It could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we're ready.
 The President. As you know, Pfizer is making this. They're taking a tremendous financial risk, and they're spending billions of dollars on actually making this vaccine. They're at a stage where they're actually making it, because they feel very confident as to the results. They'll be announcing their results fairly soon. And no, he's—that's incorrect information.
 Q. But he was pretty clear in the way he said it.
 Q.  The President. Yes, well, I think so, but I don't think he means that. I don't think he—when he said it, I believe he was confused. I'm just telling you: We're ready to go as soon as the vaccine happens.
 The President. Q. So when do you want to see it available? What would be a timeline that you would be happy with?
 Q.  The President. I would say that—yes, we will start distributing it immediately.
 The President. Q. But to the general public, not just to high-risk——
 Q.  The President. To the general public, very shortly thereafter—I mean, really, to the general public: immediately. When we go, we go. We're not looking to say, ""Gee, in 6 months, we're going to start giving it to the general public."" No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement. I saw the statement. I called him, and I said, ""What did you mean by that?"" And I think he just made a mistake. He just made a mistake. I think he misunderstood the question, probably.
 The President. Q. So if you were to put a timeline on when every person in America will be able to get a vaccine, what would that date be?
 Q.  The President. I think it would be very soon. I think our distribution process is going to go very quickly. I told you, we've engaged the military. We have a general who's in charge of all logistics, who delivers soldiers. He's a fantastic guy. He's supposed to be fantastic at what he does. And we figure that's better than any company you're going to hire. You can't hire a company like that.
 The President. And I—we look to the distribution immediately after we get the word that it's good. And I think they're having tremendous success with the vaccine itself. I think the results will be early and strong. The safety has to be a hundred percent, and we're going to insist on that. And, obviously, the companies are going to insist on that also.
 Q. So could you put an actual date to it, like, January, February, March?
 Q.  The President. Scott, what would you think?
 The President. Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Yes. The—as I said, the high-priority people will have——
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. Sure.
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. ——in sometime no later than January. I mean, of course, it depends on when things are approved and the emergency use is given.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas.  Q. But what about—I'm talking though about the low-priority people.
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. I understand. Yes. I can finish.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. Yes.
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. And then, it is anticipated there will be 700 million doses by end of Q1. That's 700 million doses.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. So by the end of March?
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. That's end of Q1.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. Dr. Atlas, do you mind if I ask you a question?
 Q.  The President. Q1, he said.
 The President. Q. Right. That's the end of March, right?
 Q.  Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. It's one thing to have the doses, but we've talked to a lot of public health experts who say if this is happening in the winter and you have to socially distance, you can't have the packed lines that we saw during H1N1. You can't have packed auditoriums. You have to space it out. So that's one thing.
 Q.  Another thing they're worried about is storing these vaccines. And since we don't know which one is the winner, you know, doctors' offices may not have dry ice to handle negative 80 degrees. So these are challenges. Are you prepared to say that you can overcome all those in 3 months?
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Yes, because, at least, I've been briefed on the vaccine, okay? And so all the refrigerators that are necessary, everything is going to be in a place for this.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. There is a very detailed logistical plan that was started months ago, and you know, you're welcome to read it on the web, but basically, yes, all those things are not a problem really. I mean, if people know how to shop for groceries or go into a store or sit in the restaurants that are open and use social distancing, I think they can do it for vaccines too.
 The President. And you also have more than one company. You have Johnson & Johnson. You have Pfizer. You have Moderna. You have others. So we could conceivably have vaccines being given out by numerous companies, and they're all world-class companies. They're fantastic companies. That could happen also. Okay?
 The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. TikTok/Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Review 
 TikTok/Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Review  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you prepared to sign off on the Oracle and TikTok deal, even though the Treasury isn't getting paid? And also, does the deal meet your requirements in terms of national security concerns?
 Q.  The President. Okay, they're giving me studies on the deal. It has to be a hundred percent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I'm not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal.
 The President. We need security, especially after what we've seen with respect to China and what's going on. We want security. So I'll let you know. They're going to be reporting to me tomorrow morning, and I will let you know.
 Q. And what about the payment?
 Q.  The President. The what?
 The President. Q. What about the payment to the Treasury?
 Q.  The President. Well, we're going to see about that. Amazingly, I find that you're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to accept—and I said: ""What kind of a government—what kind of a thing is? If they're willing to make big payments to the Government, they're not allowed, because there's no—there's no way of doing that from a—there's no legal path to doing that."" And I'm saying: ""Wait a minute. They're willing to make a big payment to the government, and we're not allowed to take the money? When does this happen? How foolish can we be?"" So we're going to—we're looking into that right now. You understand that.
 The President. In other words, I said: ""No, I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States Government because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, ""Well, there's no way of doing that."" You know why? Because nobody has ever heard of that before. Nobody has ever said that before. Nobody has ever said, ""Well, we'll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go to the Government because by approving the deal, we're making the deal valuable."" They've never heard of that before. Okay? Can you believe that? Right? Hard to believe.
 Q. On the vaccine, Mr. President——
 Q. The President. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 The President. TikTok 
 TikTok  Q. Just a quick follow-up on TikTok. You had said earlier that it was really important to you that a U.S. company buy TikTok. And according to the proposal submitted by ByteDance, ByteDance would keep a majority stake, and Oracle would have a minority stake.
 Q.  The President. Well, we're going to find out about that. We're looking into that from the standpoint of ByteDance. We don't like that. I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don't like that. That has not been told to me yet. That has been reported, but it hasn't been told to me. It could be very accurate reporting for a change. So if that's the case, I'm not going to be happy with that—assuming that ByteDance is China, which I think it probably is.
 The President. Yes. Yes, in the back, please.
 Prosecution of Political Protestors/2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Election Security 
 Prosecution of Political Protestors/2020 Presidential Election/Absentee Voting Policies/Election Security  Q. Thanks, Mr. President. Bill Barr told prosecutors that he wants to charge violent demonstrators with sedition. And you told Judge Jeanine that if there's violent demonstrations on election night: ""We'll put them down very quickly if they do that. Look, it's called the Insurrection."" So I'm wondering why you want to use that kind of rhetoric when there's such a volatile—[inaudible].
 Q.  inaudible The President. Well, the question was asked to me about if you have violent demonstrations: Yes, we will put it down very, very quickly if there is. Absolutely.
 The President. Q. Are you making plans——
 Q.  The President. And I think the American public wants to see that.
 The President. Yes. OAN, please.
 Q. What preparations are you making for violence on election night?
 Q.  The President. OAN. Yes, please. Go ahead.
 The President. Q. Thank you, Mr. President. With regards——
 Q.  The President. No, just to finish—look, if there's any kind of demonstration or violence, there will be nothing that interferes with this project—product—this vote. There's going to be nothing.
 The President. The biggest problem we have right now are the ballots. Millions of ballots going out; that's the biggest problem. When you talk about other countries, whether it's China, Russia, or many others that get mentioned, they're in a much better position with these paper ballots to do something than they would ever be under the old system. And that's our biggest problem.
 Our biggest threat to this election is Governors from opposing parties controlling ballots, millions of ballots. To me, that's a much bigger threat than foreign countries, because much of the stuff coming out about foreign countries turned out to be untrue.
 What is true is that many elections have taken place over the last year and a half, using this ballot system. They've been off by 5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent; I think I read one at 40 percent—40 percent. And these are small, easy-to-control elections.
 This whole ballot system where you can send it in, and it's not even requested—we're not talking about it solicited; they're unsolicited ballots, and they're sent in—is very dangerous for our country. And you know who knows that better than anybody? The Democrats. Look at what happened in Manhattan, where they had this kind of an election, and it was so fraudulent that it should never have been allowed to be called.
 We could have 5, 10, 15, 20 percent off; we could have more than that. The ballots will be stolen. Who knows where they're going. Who knows where they're coming from.
 Q. [Inaudible]—Federal law——
 Q. Inaudible The President. It's not just the counting of the ballots, which—by the way, which will take forever. It will take forever. You think November 3? You might not have—I guess, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. You know, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. You know that.
 The President. Q. [Inaudible]
 Q. Inaudible The President. This is a disgrace. This is being done on purpose. They know it's no good. They know it's—it's going to be fraudulent. It's going to be fraud all over the place. Who's getting the ballots? Who's sending the ballots? They have people saying you don't need a verified signature. This is a serious threat to our democracy, and the Democrats know that.
 The President.  All we're asking: If you solicit the ballot—you go through a process—you ask for a ballot because you can't be there for a large number of reasons, for whatever—I'm doing it myself. I won't be able to be in Florida. You solicit, and they send it back. You do it, and you send it back. That's a process that you go through. And it's pretty secure. I use the word ""pretty"" secure. I guess nothing is foolproof.
 But what's pretty close to what—the most foolproof thing, the thing that really works is you go to the ballot box. It's going to be very safe.
 Q. [Inaudible]
 Q. Inaudible The President. I think by that time, COVID will be even lower. It's going to be very low. It's going to be a very safe process. We did it during World War I. We did it during World War II.
 The President. The biggest threat to this election is these unsolicited ballots sent out by the millions, controlled by Governors like in Nevada, who is a political person—very political, far beyond being Governor—where they tried to stop you from making a speech, unsuccessfully, but we had to move around a lot, had to move quickly. So the same guy that tried to stop you from making free speech outside—outside, not inside; outside—they forced us inside because of what they did—but outside. This is the guy that's controlling ballots.
 Then you look at Pennsylvania. You look at other places. It is a big threat. And as far as China is concerned and Russia and they say North Korea, they say Iran, they say places. Who knows? Who knows? But they say all these different places.
 They can make forgeries of these ballots. They can do things that will blow your mind. And the Democrats know it's wrong. They know it's going to end up being a disaster. Just take a look at what's happened. Take a look at what's happened over the last year with this same kind of thing, except in a very small setting with very few ballots going out, so that's much easier; not 53 to 80 million going out. A very small number.
 And you know what's happened? Fraud like you've never seen. Missing ballots. Ballots that never showed up. Ballots with bad signatures. Ballots with no signatures. And in the case of Nevada, they don't even want verification of the signature. It's a disgrace.
 Now, the hope for our Nation is: It's before judges. In Pennsylvania, it's before judges. In Nevada, it's before judges. In other places it's before Federal judges. And hopefully, they'll do what they did the other day in Pennsylvania where we had a great victory.
 Open up your State. It's unconstitutional to close it. Because what they were doing is closing it, and they're closing it for political reasons. It will open on November 4. It will open up right after the election. But they want people to—they want our numbers to be as bad as possible, but the problem is our numbers are so good with or without various States opening up. With or without.
 But we had a big legal victory, as you know, 3 days ago. A Federal judge told them to open up their State. ""It's unconstitutional what you're doing."" That's in the case of Pennsylvania.
 Now the big cases are going to be the cases on these unsolicited ballots. And we'll see what happens.
 All right. OAN, please.
 Q. Can I ask about something else, please? Mr. President——
 Q. China 
 China  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the grounds that the Chinese Communist Party has been using slave labor in Xinjiang, your administration has imposed a limited ban on certain products coming out of Xinjiang, stopping short of a full region ban. What is your response to the Chinese Communist Party's spokespeople who are saying that this is an outright lie. Xinjiang does not have forced labor.
 Q.  And number two, have allies expressed interest in standing with this administration in taking action against forced labor imposed by the Communist Party?
 The President. Yes, we don't want to see that. We've been very strong on that. We're getting reports in. Over the next 2 or 3 days, we'll know very accurately what the story is, and we'll then take action one way or the other.
 The President. Go ahead.
 World Trade Organization/China-U.S. Trade 
 World Trade Organization/China-U.S. Trade  Q. Yes, I just wanted to ask you about the WTO's recent ruling against the United States over $200 billion in tariffs on China. Should the U.S. remain part of the WTO?
 Q.  The President. Well, I have real questions about it. Look, the U.S.—we just won a seven-and-a-half-billion-dollar lawsuit, which—nobody used to sue before I came along, you know—or they used to lose them every single time. Now they haven't been losing them.
 The President. But we're getting reports on the WTO. It's not good. Never been good to us. The WTO, as far as I'm concerned, was created to suck money and jobs out of the United States to the benefit of China and other countries—that's what my opinion is—whether it was created or it just turned out to be that way.
 But the World Trade Organization has been not good for the United States. It's been good for everybody else, but it's not been good. It was a method, in my opinion, of taking advantage of the United States. So we're looking into what happened, and we'll let—we'll get back to you fast.
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution  Q. Mr. President, two questions. One, you said you spoke with Dr. Redfield earlier, and you said that he made a mistake. Did——
 Q.  The President. I think he made a mistake. Yes, but we didn't—I didn't go into any great—I was very surprised to hear it. It doesn't really matter.
 The President. Here's what does matter: We're all set to distribute immediately. As soon as that vaccine comes out that's safe and good and works—whether it's Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or anybody else—we are ready to distribute it very rapidly. As Scott said and as our team knows—and they're ready. And that could be on—it could be in October, sometime in October or November. I don't think it's going to be much later than that. But I think it could be sometime in October. We're ready to move, and it will be a very full distribution.
 Q. So you all had the call. You said that you told him that he had made a mistake. What was his response and did he acknowledge that?
 Q.  The President. No, I didn't tell him anything. I said, ""What happened?"" And I got the impression that he didn't realize he said what he might have said. I didn't see him say it.
 The President. Q. But did——
 Q The President. But if that's what he said, it's a mistake because here's—so, ready? We're ready to distribute immediately to a vast section of our country and then beyond, because we want to help other countries also. But we're ready to distribute immediately.
 The President. Q. But the timeline that he gave, saying that it wouldn't be ready for the general public until the middle of next year, sounds very like the one that you, kind of, just offered.
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. No. No, I said that there'll be 700 million doses by end of Q1, and everyone in high risk will have it sometime no later than January.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. Yes, he was talking—he said the general public——
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. That's what I said.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Q. ——for next year.
 Q.  The President. No—we are focused, as you know——
 The President. Q. He wasn't talking about high-risk or the health care—[inaudible]—workers——
 Q.  inaudible The President. Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN], we're focused on high-risk, but we're going to focus also on general public very much. But we are—our immediate aim is elderly people, and especially elderly people with heart, diabetes problems.
 The President. Q. Sure.
 Q. The President. But we will have it—this is—we're not looking at a small distribution program; we're looking at distributing to the whole United States with an immediate focus of the elderly.
 The President.  Now, under no circumstance, will it be as late as the doctor said. But I think that, frankly, if he analyzes—you know, they hit him with that question. He said that. We are ready at a much faster level than what he said. We will have rapid distribution. We're set up—our military and others are set up to do it, and we think it could even start taking place in October, but certainly, during November, December would be the latest. Because, based on what we're hearing, results are—based on what I'm hearing, results are very good. So we'll see what happens.
 Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Coronavirus Vaccine Development/The President's Approach to the Middle East Peace Process/Iran 
 Washington Post Associate Editor Bob Woodward's Forthcoming Book/Coronavirus Vaccine Development/The President's Approach to the Middle East Peace Process/Iran  Q. Okay. So my last question is: You told Bob Woodward the problem with a vaccine is, a vaccine will take 13 to 14 months once you have because you have to test a vaccine. So do you want to clarify what you told Bob Woodward?
 Q.  The President. Well, what I was—what I was saying to him—no, that was a long time ago when I said that. I didn't—we weren't set up at that time.
 The President. Q. It wasn't that long ago.
 Q.  The President. Well, how many months ago? When was the statement made?
 The President. Q. He doesn't say in the book when it was made.
 Q.  The President. You know, his book is, sort of, obsolete because the book comes out——
 The President. Q. But he only started interviewing you in December.
 Q.  The President. By the way, I read the book last night, very rapidly because it was very boring. I read it. And if you see what I said, I said a lot of really good things. I mean, for the most part, people like to turn it around, but I said really good things in that book.
 The President. And as an example, he doesn't cover—I told him what we're doing in the Middle East, and we're doing it in an entirely different way. And that's not covered in his book. The whole thing isn't covered in his book.
 And one thing I will say—and I respect the press for this one, which was interesting—almost universally, we've been praised for the deal that we made yesterday with Israel and with, you know, the two very important countries in the Middle East. And U.A.E., in particular, where it's a very powerful group. It's a warrior country. It's led by a great warrior and a man who's highly respected. And if you take a look at that and Bahrain and Israel making a deal—and I will tell you, we have at least four or five others that want to come in. They would have come in yesterday. I talked to two of them yesterday, and they're ready to trot.
 And I think you're going to have a whole level of peace without blood all over the sand. Nobody was shot. Nobody was killed. We killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East. It's all—it's been—I always say, it's the bloodiest sand anywhere in the world, and it didn't have to be that way. The single worst decision our country ever made was to go into the Middle East. Not only the millions of people killed—and I include people on both sides. You know, some people say, ""Oh, you shouldn't say that."" I'll say it: ""on both sides."" Such a horrible thing was done. Such a horrible mistake was made. We're doing this a different way. So we have those two countries. We have at least five that we're negotiating with right now. And you know, you can only negotiate with so many. I think they're all going to come in.
 I think, ultimately, the Palestinians are going to come in. These are all the people that are funding them. You know, I stopped funding the Palestinians fairly early on, because they were saying bad things about our country. I said, ""Well, you mean we're giving them $750 million a year, and they're saying all bad things about our country?"" So I stopped funding them very early on. But they get funded by other very rich countries. To them, it's like a speck; it's nothing. But they get funded.
 And—but I think now that these countries—these very rich countries are part of the deal, and they're going—you'll see, over the next fairly short period of time, other countries will come in. I think Saudi Arabia, ultimately, will come in too. I think getting Saudi Arabia will be great. But I think Saudi Arabia—this is my feeling; it's not based on knowledge, other than a couple of conversations I had with the King. But Saudi Arabia, I think, will be coming in too.
 And you'll end up in—with peace in the Middle East. And nobody thought it could be done, and nobody thought it could be done this way.
 I went to some very smart people.
 Q. But——
 Q. The President. I went to some people in the Middle East, and they said: ""You'll never be able to do it. It's not possible to make peace."" Well, now they're saying to me, ""Nobody ever thought of doing this."" They all thought you make the deal first with the Palestinians; it had to be that way.
 The President. And I will say the resistance was: Some countries didn't want to do it unless the Palestinians were there first. That was just a psychological thing more than anything else, but they were wrong. Those countries—the people—our great representatives that have been doing this for 35 years that were telling me how to do it—but they all failed. They were Clinton's administration, they were in Bush, they were in Obama—all these great, brilliant people. They're all telling me how to do it, and I said, ""They're wrong."" And I guess I was right. And——
 Q. Okay, but on this vaccine——
 Q.  The President. And when you see—let me just—well, let's talk—finish this.
 The President. Q. Okay.
 Q. The President. When you see the countries that will be coming—a very short period of time; not talking in a long period of time—all of the countries that will be coming in, just like you saw—Bahrain yesterday, and U.A.E., and I can think of, I mean, at least five that are going to be quick and easy. Others will be quick and easy also, once the five comes—come in.
 The President So you're going to have something; you're going to peace in the Middle East. And we want to get out, you know. We want to—our soldiers are largely coming home. I said they're—the endless wars; the ridiculous, endless wars.
 And I will say this: If I didn't withdraw our country from that horrible Iran nuclear deal—that horrible, stupid deal, where President Obama paid $150 billion for nothing and gave $1.8 billion in cash—$1.8 billion. You know what that is? $1.8 billion in cash. That's more impressive than the $150 billion paid normally.
 But he gave all this money, all of this—all of these chips that we had. We had these chips, and he gave them all away. And we got nothing. And you know, it was a short-term deal. It would be practically expiring now. It would be practically—it starts to expire, actually, right now. But it would practically be—and there is no way we will let Iran have a nuclear weapon. Just remember that. There's no way that's going to happen.
 Okay.
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. But, sir, are you reversing the statement? You never answered about the statement. Just—I'll just let you go after this, but do you want to reverse what you told Woodward about the 13- to 14-month timeline for a vaccine?
 Q.  The President. Well, the vaccine—at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we've stepped it up very substantially.
 The President. And now—I mean, I'm just telling you the—this is just what it is. We've been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up. I freed up the FDA. Dr. Hahn has done a great job. And they're ready to approve something when they come in.
 The other thing that's happening that's very different is—you look at a company like Pfizer, a great company—really, one of the great companies of the world. Johnson & Johnson. They're all great companies. They're doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody has ever seen anything like it. You know, they're out in third—they're in the third level of trial. And I think that you're going to see things that are amazing.
 When I made statements like that—that's an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we're producing. But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast.
 If this were a—an administration from the past—and I think I can say ""far beyond Obama,"" if—it was other administrations also—you wouldn't have a vaccine for 2½, 3 years. And we're going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months.
 Okay?
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. The President. John [John Roberts, Fox News].
 The President Coronavirus Relief Legislation 
 Coronavirus Relief Legislation  Q. Mr. President, if I could ask you about coronavirus relief: Do you support the Problem Solvers Caucus proposal that was put forward?
 Q.  The President. Yes——
 The President. Q. Are you comfortable with the——
 Q.  The President. ——something like that.
 The President.  Q. ——$500 billion for the States?
 Q.  The President. Something like that. Yes, I like the larger amount. I've said that, you know. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with it, because I like the larger number.
 The President. I want to see people get money. I want to see—it wasn't their fault that this happened. It was China's fault, you know? People say: ""Oh, maybe you shouldn't say that. That's not nice."" It was China's fault. So I'd like to see the larger number. Yes, I would like to see it. There are some things I disagree with, but I'm sure they can be negotiated.
 Q. On that point——
 Q.  The President. Now, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't want to leave until we have an agreement. She's come a long way. That's great. If she said that, she's come a long way.
 The President. I agree with her. We should have an agreement. People should be helped, and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it's going to happen. I think it's very important.
 So the Problem Solvers came up with—it's a group of people in Congress, as you know. You know them all. I know them all. They're very good people. I guess you'd consider them dead center. But in many cases, they're not. They're left. They're right. But they came up with this idea, and I think they're well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things.
 Yes.
 Q. So in terms of things——
 Q.  The President. I agree with a lot of it.
 The President. Q. In terms of things that you don't agree, are you comfortable with the $500 billion?
 Q.  The President. I think the things I don't agree we can probably negotiate. But I think we've made some progress over the last week, and I think it was positive that they came out with that report.
 The President. Q. So, just to button this up, would you endorse that proposal?
 Q.  The President. Well, not that proposal, but we're getting closer. We're getting closer.
 The President. I do like a lot of money getting sent to people that really were—really were hurt unnecessarily by China, because they could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into their country. They could have stopped it from coming to our country and from going to Europe and from going to the rest of the world, 188 different countries from all over the world.
 Please.
 Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
 Coronavirus Containment Efforts/Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. Mr. President, the Director of the CDC also testified today that a mask, in his estimation, is guaranteed——
 Q.  The President. The mask.
 The President. Q. ——is guaranteed to protect the American public more from the coronavirus than a vaccine. And you have, as detailed, poured a lot of resources into a vaccine development. Why not devote your energy——
 Q.  The President. And to masks.
 The President. Q. Then why not devote your energy now to a campaign to have all Americans wear a mask, something that if more effective than a vaccine, would also help schools and the economy?
 Q.  The President. Okay, number one, it's not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that. Those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question. Because I said to him—I asked him those two questions: the one question which we covered and the mask question.
 The President. And I was inaccurately covered, because I was on with George last night—George Stephanopoulos. And I enjoyed it. I think people enjoyed it. I got—you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well. But they said a lot of good things about the show, but they always cut my sentences off. You know, they cut it off.
 On masks, the masks have problems too. And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks, and they're playing around with their mask, and they have it—their fingers are in their mask, and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks.
 No, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have—added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers. I'm just reading you statistics that are from wherever they get them. But they're very highly qualified statistics.
 But no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask, perhaps, helps. Don't forget: A lot of people didn't like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them, and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.
 But when I called up Robert today, I said to him, ""What's with the masks?"" He said, ""I think I answered that question incorrectly."" I think maybe he misunderstood it. I mean, you know, you have two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one is, it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster.
 As far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks, because people have used the masks. But when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we write—if you do the good job—they had, I guess, 240,000. But if you do the good—if it worked out well—now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much; should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000—between a hundred and something and 240,000.
 As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake.
 Q. But, on the masks, I mean, perhaps they are a part of the role for the decrease in cases because they are effective, as you just said. So I know you've worn it a few——
 Q.  The President. No, they may be effective.
 The President. Q. Right, sure.
 Q.  The President. And I wear them when I'm in a hospital or when I'm in a setting with a lot of——
 The President. Q. But my question is: Why not wear it more often or have the White House staff wear it more often to set an example for the country?
 Q.  The President. Well, I'm tested, and I'm sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting and—like, with Joe. Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don't know, maybe he doesn't want to expose his face. I don't know what's going on. He'll be way away from people, nowhere near people—there will be nobody with him. He doesn't draw any crowds. He'll have circles. These big circles. They'll be way far away. There's no reason for him to have masks on.
 The President. We get tested—I'm tested; I have people tested. When people come into the Oval Office, it's like a big deal. No matter who they are—if they're heads of countries, they all get tested. So I'm in sort of a different position. And maybe if I wasn't in that position, I'd be wearing it more. But I've worn masks. And especially I like to wear them when I'm in hospital. Not for me so much as for other people. Okay? Thanks. Yes.
 Q. Mr. President, can I just ask you about—hang on. Could I——
 Q. National Economy/Unemployment Rates Among Minorities/2020 Presidential Election/Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution 
 National Economy/Unemployment Rates Among Minorities/2020 Presidential Election/Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution  Q. I have two questions, Mr. President. One is for Dr. Atlas. Dr. Atlas, you mentioned minorities would be the first focus of the distribution. How would that exactly work in practice when it's being distributed specifically to minorities?
 Q.  And then, secondly, for you, Mr.——
 The President. Well, he didn't say ""minorities""; he said ""minorities and senior citizens.""
 The President. Q. Well, he said the focus——
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President. Q. Sure. Sure. But can you talk us through a bit more on the focus on distributing to minorities and how that would work?
 Q.  And then for you, Mr. President, you mentioned the drop in the poverty rate. Specifically, we noticed at—just the news that the poverty rate for African Americans hit historic lows, that the household wealth increased historically for African Americans. What was driving that increase in wealth for African Americans?
 And now, in 2020, with the coronavirus, with unemployment spiking, what would be your plan for the second term to improve lives for African Americans?
 The President. Well, I'll go first, because of your question—I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest—the best employment numbers that we've ever had—both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.
 The President. But we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.
 And yes, the—I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans—they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far—both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.
 Thank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too?
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Okay. Yes, so what I—to clarify, I said that the first prioritization is the high-risk people and frontline health care workers.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. But just to reiterate, what I said, there are 51,000 outlets for distribution for vaccination, and there's over 14,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers that are particularly targeted to minority and low-income areas. So that's a focus.
 And I want to point out two other things. We're also prioritizing testing at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and we're in the process of getting that finalized because we know that there's high—there's a higher morbidity with—in certain ethnic groups.
 And last thing I would say is, it's particularly heinous—an egregious abuse of the media to instill fear into people about taking a vaccine, because there is no shortcut here. Everything is safe. Everything is effective. And for people who have particularly an influence on minority communities to instill fear and doubt is a particularly, you know, outrageous abuse of public policy and of leadership. These are people that have higher risk.
 And so I implore everyone who is in a high-risk category that when we get a safe, effective vaccine, they should take the vaccine.
 The President. I will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started—just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.
 The President. Just like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put—with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.
 And I say that, just like—even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy—I guess, the head person—I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.
 This story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to—for massive distribution to everybody—with a focus, again, on seniors.
 And I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion—because they have had a difficult problem there—we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.
 But we—when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.
 Now what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, ""Oh, the United States""—well—but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it's a good suggestion.
 Yes, please, go ahead.
 Q. Mr. President——
 Q. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution/Federal Coronavirus Response 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution/Federal Coronavirus Response  Q. Yes, thank you.
 Q.  The President. Go ahead.
 The President. Q. The core of Vice President Biden's argument is that you don't trust the scientists; you don't listen to them. And here, up on the podium today, you're twice contradicting the Director of your own CDC on the science, who testified before Congress today.
 Q.  The President. No, he's contradicting himself.
 The President. Q. Why should the American people——
 Q.  The President. I think he misunderstood the questions.
 The President. Q. Well, he was testifying under oath. Why should——
 Q.  The President. You know what I think?
 The President. Q. ——the American people——
 Q.  The President. I think he misunderstood—I told you, I don't have to go through this. I think he misunderstood the questions. But I'm telling you, here's the bottom line: Distribution is going to be very rapid. He may not know that. Maybe he's not aware of that, and maybe he's not dealing with the military, et cetera, like I do. Distribution is going to be very rapid. And the vaccine is going to be very powerful. It's going to solve a tremendous problem. It's going to be very powerful.
 The President. Q. But how—the broader question is: How can the American people trust you on the pandemic when you're contradicting the head of the CDC in your own administration?
 Q.  The President. Because of the great job we've done. Because of the great things we've done in other fields, also. Because of the fact that we created ventilators. We built ventilators by the thousands and now we're supplying to the world.
 The President. Because of all of the incredible work we've done for Governors, who are, on every call, saying: ""This is incredible. This is great. This is great."" Sometimes, they're not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it.
 But we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it; I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job.
 I get calls from other people in other countries. They can't believe the job we've done. And then they'll say, ""Is there any way that you could get us ventilators?"" I say, ""How many do you need?"" ""One thousand ventilators."" I said, ""We'll be able to take care of it."" We're making thousands of ventilators—very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We're making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here.
 And I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid and very—it's going to be all-encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems—senior citizens, et cetera—but it's a very powerful—it's a—it's going to be very powerful distribution. It's going to cover everybody, and it's going to cover them rapidly.
 I don't know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers. But I called him because I said, ""Why did you say that long?"" He wasn't that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It's going to be extremely strong. It's going to be extremely successful. We're not going to have a problem.
 And the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people—professionals—Scott, you would know a lot of them—but there are some people that don't like the mask, because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you're touching everything else. They have—they feel that masks have problems.
 So anyway, go ahead, in the back, please.
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr. 
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr.  Q. Mr. President, do you have confidence—Mr. President, do you have confidence in Dr. Redfield? Having listened to you——
 Q.  The President. Yes, I—I do. I do. I do.
 The President. Q. Well, you've just said he keeps getting the answers wrong——
 Q.  The President. Well, he gave you some answers——
 The President. Q. ——he misunderstands questions.
 Q.  The President. He, sort of, I think, maybe misunderstood a question. But we're beyond that now. We're really in final stages of vaccines. We're getting ready to go phase one on distribution. And I think it may come out even sooner than you think.
 The President. I think the vaccine is going to be even better than people thought originally. I think people are going to be really surprised at the success of the vaccine. I think it's going to be a tremendous success. And we're fighting a very powerful party—with a poor candidate, in my opinion—but we're fighting a very, very powerful party, and they're partners with the media, and—because they're working together very closely.
 And they only started hitting on the vaccine—when they hit on the vaccine, they only hit on it when they realize that: ""Wow, this is amazing. They may have it even before the election."" All of a sudden, they didn't like the vaccine so much.
 Q. Mr. President, one other thing——
 Q.  The President. Yes, in the back, please. Go ahead.
 The President. Coronavirus Cases Among White House Staff 
 Coronavirus Cases Among White House Staff  Q. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Were you informed about positive coronavirus cases in the White House today?
 Q.  The President. You're going to—I cannot hear you, I'm sorry.
 The President. Q. Were you informed about coronavirus cases—positive cases—in the White House today?
 Q.  The President. About today?
 The President. Q. Yes.
 Q.  Q. On your staff.
 Q.  Q. On your staff.
 Q.  Q. Just—any positive cases today, sir?
 Q.  Q. Yes.
 Q.  The President. Say it.
 The President. Q. Are there cases at the White House?
 Q.  Q. Were there positives cases today, sir?
 Q.  Q. There are reports of White House staff members testing positive for coronavirus today.
 Q.  The President. Oh, I see. About staff? You mean about——
 The President. Q. Yes.
 Q.  The President. I heard about it this morning, at a very small level. Yes. I heard about this morning.
 The President. Q. How many people?
 Q.  Q. How many?
 Q.  The President. I don't know. We can have a report to you if you feel it's necessary.
 The President. Q. Were they yesterday at the event?
 Q.  The President. But it's a small—it's—last night I heard about it for the first time. And it's a small number of cases. Maybe it's not even cases.
 The President. Do you know if—do you have any idea if there's——
 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Yes.
 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The President. What is it?
 The President. Press Secretary McEnany. There—yes, but we're not going to confirm the identities of the individuals.
 Press Secretary McEnany. The President. Yes, that's okay.
 The President. Press Secretary McEnany. Yes, but it did not affect the event, and press was not around the individual.
 Press Secretary McEnany. Q. How many?
 Q.  The President. And it's not anybody that was near me.
 The President. Q. How many?
 Q.  Q. Mr. President, how many people?
 Q.  Q. Was it at the event last night?
 Q.  The President. A very—from what I heard, a very small number. I think you can probably give the number out later on when you find out what it might be.
 The President. Press Secretary McEnany. Yes, it's one person.
 Press Secretary McEnany. The President. One person?
 The President. Q. One person?
 Q.  The President. It was one person. Okay.
 The President. Q. In Philadelphia? In Philadelphia? Was the——
 Q.  The President. It was one person. That's—I mean, so not too much. Not a person that I was associated with.

"30","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 18, 2020        ","The President. Thank you very much, everyone. So a lot of work has been going on with respect to the vaccines, very successful work, I might add. We have three great, great companies doing somewhat different variations, but they're all looking very good.
 The President. From the beginning of the China virus, all nations have understood that our top priority must be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible to end the pandemic and get life back to normal. The successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives, it will put an end to the restrictions and some of the things that go on and have to go on in the meantime.
 Today I want to discuss the historic progress we're making to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time. And there's never been anything like this ever. In our history, there's never been any—in history, period—world history.
 Since January, America's brilliant doctors and scientists have been working around the clock. These are the best medical minds in the world, by far. And the vaccines are going through the gold standard of clinical trials, and very heavy emphasis placed on safety. Three vaccines are already in the final stage.
 Joe Biden's antivaccine theories are putting a lot of lives at risk. And they're only doing it for political reasons; it's very foolish. It's part of their war to try and discredit the vaccine, now that they know that we essentially have it. We'll be announcing it fairly soon.
 As part of Operation Warp Speed, my administration is manufacturing all of the most promising vaccines in advance. And actually, it will be fairly long in advance. As soon as a vaccine is approved, the administration will deliver it to the American people immediately. Distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice.
 And the general—I think those are the words specifically you wanted us to use?
 Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer General Gustave F. Perna, USA. Yes, Mr. President.
 Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer General Gustave F. Perna, USA. The President. Within 24 hours, you're all set to go. And massive amounts will be delivered through our great military. And the general is one of our best, and he is ready to go.
 The President. We'll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and likely much more than that. Hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month. And we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.
 And, again, I'll say that even at that later stage, the delivery will go—as fast as it comes, they can deliver. They're very good. Best—I think probably the best in the world.
 The estimates I'm providing today are based on the manufacturing that's in process, and that's in process immediately, right now. We've already exceeded our ambitious goals.
 Under the Defense Production Act, contracts that we've secured—we may even get far above these numbers. And numbers that I'm telling you today, I think we'll exceed them very, very substantially. And I think that also includes distribution. I think distribution will go even quicker than most people think. I'm relying on our military. Everything I've done with our military, it's worked out very well. In a short time, we'll have a safe and effective vaccine, and we'll defeat the virus. Interestingly, as I was saying that go ""very well,"" just like what we did with our military with respect to ISIS went very well, long ahead of schedule. They have been incredible in working with me.
 Let's go to Puerto Rico, because Puerto Rico has been hit very, very hard by a lot of different storms, and they're great people. It's a great place. I know it well. Great place.
 Today my administration is making the largest emergency relief award in history to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid and educational system. We're awarding $13 billion to permanently repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines that should have been done many years ago.
 This was beyond even the storms. This was just age and a lot of the salt. The salt from that ocean is a killer for electrical stations and power generation systems. But, on top of the salt, you had these massive storms or hurricanes come in. And Maria, in particular, was a disaster.
 But for many years, they've been trying to get this done, and they haven't had the political will power in Washington to get it done. So we're going to get it done for them.
 We're also going to be bringing back very, very major amounts of medical work. You know, we used to have pharmaceutical manufacturing at levels that few places had, and a lot of it has left Puerto Rico. And we're going to bring that back, especially now, since our emphasis is going to be making our product. So we're going to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to Puerto Rico. A lot of it left over the years, over a long period of time. It's been leaving and going to China and other places. So we're bringing all of that back.
 This was done in previous administrations. I'd like to just point out, we've done more for Puerto Rico than anybody. And this is just an example of it, but we've done more for Puerto Rico, by far, than anybody.
 We'll also be launching a major effort to repair and renovate the schools across the island. Following Hurricane Maria, my administration immediately deployed the full power of the Federal Government to bring the electric grid back on line so they could at least temporarily—and it certainly wasn't a permanent fix; it was ripped to shreds. But a lot of that was ripped to shreds long before even the storm came in. For many, many years, they've been trying to do it. But we wanted to restore water supplies. And we did make emergency repairs to critical infrastructure, which we took care of, and saved countless lives, which we did.
 FEMA's response in Puerto Rico included the longest sustained air mission, supplying food and water, in American history. We supplied it for long after the hurricane was gone. The largest disaster commodity distribution mission in U.S. history and the largest sea bridge operation in Federal disaster aid in U.S. history.
 My administration has also prepositioned vast quantities of relief supplies for the future disasters. Unfortunately, Puerto Rico is in the way of a lot of different storms, a lot of hurricanes. And the island is now stocked with nearly 8 times as much drinking water and 13 times as much food as it had before I took office. So they're ready to go if something should happen.
 They got brushed by a storm recently, but they're in a good position. So we're going to bring back medical distribution and manufacturing to Puerto Rico and at a level far greater than it was before.
 And it's been emptied out. It's been largely—it largely left the island for many years. At one point, it was a—it was the talk of the world, and now it's the talk of the world in a different way. We're bringing it back. So we're going to be bringing it back from various other parts of the world. It's going to Puerto Rico. And I think that's going to be very exciting for the people. And we're undertaking the largest Federal investment in Puerto Rico's history. So you have a lot of—I have a lot of friends in Puerto Rico, and I told them about it—asked them about it. ""Conceptually, what do you think?"" And they're very excited.
 I just want to say, by contrast, Biden has devastated the island of Puerto Rico. He—Joe Biden, what he's done to Puerto Rico, meaning the past administration, is devastating.
 In 1996, Biden voted to eliminate a critical tax provision that had allowed Puerto Rico to become a dominant player in global pharmaceutical manufacturing. That's what happened. When Biden voted to repeal this provision, the pharmaceutical industry was ripped out of Puerto Rico. All incentive to stay there was taken away, and all of the jobs went to China and other places, but mostly to China. That's what happened. This was done with a vote of Biden. This was even before the Obama administration. This was early on. But so sad that that was done.
 And then, Obama came in, and it got worse. So, for the people of Puerto Rico: They were a disaster for you. And I have to say, in a very nice way, a very respectful way, I'm the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. Nobody even close.
 But as a result, the island's economy, under the previously mentioned names, it just absolutely cratered. Biden's vote also left the United States at the mercy of foreign suppliers for essential medicines, putting our national security and our health at risk.
 We had a tremendous industry potentially going to Puerto Rico, and they just absolutely cut it short with bad votes and took all the incentive away, and it went to other places—faraway lands. So they really, in a sense, were voting to destroy Puerto Rico. And we're bringing Puerto Rico back, and we'll have it done fairly quickly.
 And the $13 billion is a—that's a tremendous amount of money, but it's a very important amount. And I think you're going to see something terrific. And it's very exciting. To me, what—the most exciting is bringing the whole pharmaceutical industry back.
 We've spoken to various companies, and they're willing to go there. They want to have a little bit of help, but they're willing to go to Puerto Rico. And Puerto Rico is going to be very exciting, what's going to happen. They were on the verge of doing it, and they took away all the incentives. I don't know how that was allowed to happen, but they allowed it to happen. That was very, very bad for Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Rico. That was done by Democrats, and a Republican is bringing it back.
 So, with that, we can take a few questions. And we are, again, very advanced on the vaccine. We think that sometime in the very near future, we'll have it. We're, I would say—I think I can say—years ahead of schedule, what it would be if it were an administration other than this one. It would have been—you would have been years before you ever had anything approved by the FDA.
 John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.
 Federal Aid to Puerto Rico 
 Federal Aid to Puerto Rico  Q. Mr. President, this huge aid package to Puerto Rico: Why not a year ago? Why not 2 years ago? Why not 3 years ago? Why 46 days to the election?
 Q.  The President. Because what we're doing is, we've been working on it for a long time to get it passed. Very tough to get things past Democrats, where they don't want to see this happen. And they probably, certainly, didn't want to see it happen at this point.
 The President. But it's a big package. It's a great package. And I think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars; it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We're going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there, but they changed the tax situation; they ripped it out. So they really ripped apart the island, and we're going to bring it back, John.
 Q. It may be simply coincidental, but it does coincide with a big push for Puerto Rican voters that the Biden-Harris campaign——
 Q.  The President. Yes, I think that that's probably—well, they can't do anything. Look, the Biden-Harris campaign, what they did—they hurt—you know, I've gone through it. And whether it was President Obama or Vice President Biden, they were a disaster for Puerto Rico. A disaster.
 The President. And what we're doing and what we've done—but what we're doing is something that will be fantastic for many years in the future. Bringing back the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturing in Puerto Rico, is what they've wanted for years, and we're doing that, in addition to the $13 billion.
 Yes, please.
 Q. Mr. President, sir——
 Q. Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution 
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution  Q. Mr. President, I think I heard you right, saying that—you said that there should—you expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April. So as we sit here in mid-September and there have been questions about the timeline, can you walk us through now and the beginning of April, to which every American can have a vaccine and what that might look like?
 Q.  The President. Sure. And I think we may exceed those numbers, even.
 The President. Scott, do you want to discuss that quickly?
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Sure. As has been said many times——
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. Q. From the podium, please.
 Q.  Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Okay. And we have all the people that are involved in the actual vaccine distribution here, but we were just going through this. As of the end of the year, we will have over a hundred million doses manufactured. The people who are on the prioritized list of—including high risk, including first responders—will have the ability to take the vaccine—no one is being mandated to be vaccinated—at the latest, in January.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. And as we said yesterday and—or I think yesterday—there will be hundreds of millions of doses delivered for people to take it during the first quarter. And so that, by April, every single American who wants to be vaccinated will have the ability to be vaccinated. It's not a forced vaccination, of course.
 Q. And when did you—Dr. Fauci said today—basically echoed Dr. Redfield's comments that Q2, Q3—at some point the summer of next year—the entire country, potentially, or at least as many Americans that need to be vaccinated will be vaccinated. Is that the timeline?
 Q.  The President. We'd like to beat that number, yes. But we think we will.
 The President. Q. Next summer, the rest——
 Q.  The President. Yes, that's—that's on the outer edge. We think we can beat that number very substantially.
 The President. TikTok
 TikTok Q. And on TikTok, sir, if you don't—if you don't mind: The Commerce Department essentially gave you a runway today to strike a deal after the election. Do you expect the TikTok deal before the election or after the election?
 Q.  The President. I think it could go quickly. We have great companies talking to us about it. You know about Oracle; you know Microsoft has been involved, and let's see whether or not they're continuing to be involved. Walmart is truly a great company. They are very much involved; they want to do something.
 The President. So we have some great options, and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy, but have the security that we need. We have to have the total security from China. Just know we're not going to do anything to jeopardize security.
 At the same time, it's an amazing company and very, very popular. So if we can do a combination of both, I'd be very happy doing that. It could go very quickly though. It could go very, very fast.
 Q. Mr. President, sir——
 Q. The President. Yes, please.
 The President. Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
 Q.  Q. Mr. President——
 Q.  The President. Go ahead, please.
 The President. Q. What do you——
 Q.  Q. The Kuwaiti——
 Q.  The President. OAN.
 The President. Middle East Peace Process/Syria/Iraq/Afghanistan 
 Middle East Peace Process/Syria/Iraq/Afghanistan  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On Kuwait: So the Ambassador to—the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Austria this week told the IAEA that the Kuwaiti Government is very concerned over Iran's constant breaching of the JCPOA. In your discussions with the Kuwaitis today, have you discussed where they stand this week as we go into the U.N., as the United States tries to extend sanctions on Iran?
 Q.  The President. Well, they just left my office, as you know, the Oval Office. And we had a very good meeting with the Amir, and I think we understand each other very well. They're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries, and I think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it.
 The President. I have, I would say, seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. And not only is it happening, it's happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly, because that's an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely.
 But we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. You know, we've brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future.
 We're out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil. And we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we're out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately, we got it down to 50, and I thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight, and you have 50 people in the middle. I don't care who you are, even if you're the U.S., those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out.
 But we had a lot of troops on the border, and we took them out. I said, ""Look, they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that."" That's not for us; we're guarding our own borders. We're doing very well on our southern border, as an example.
 So we're out of Syria, except we kept the oil, and we'll make a determination. We'll probably be dealing with the Kurds and the oil and see what it all ends up. But we'll be out.
 And very importantly, we're down to very few soldiers in Iraq, and we're down—we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000—less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. And then we'll make that final determination a little bit later on.
 We're dealing very well with the Taliban. They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp. But you know, it's been 19 years, and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. And we really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn't fight it properly. They were police, okay? They're not police; they're soldiers. So there's a difference. The police—nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing.
 So we're having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It's been public. And—but we'll be down to—very shortly, we'll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. And so we'll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen—certain things have to be fulfilled. But 19 years is a long time, 8,000 miles away. Nineteen years is a long time.
 And the Middle East—the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what's happened, if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made—I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran. Had that deal stayed and had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in.
 And I had two calls this morning with countries; they want to know, ""When can we go into the deal?"" They want to go. It's not that we're giving them anything. They want security, they want peace, and they're really tired of fighting. It's incredible. They're tired of fighting. They've been fighting for so many years. They're tired of fighting. Thank you very much.
 Q. Mr. President, sir. Mr. President——
 Q. Federal Aid to Puerto Rico 
 Federal Aid to Puerto Rico  Q. Mr. President, a question on the vaccine, but first, on Puerto Rico: I heard you many times over the past couple of years saying that Puerto Rico got too much money. I mean, just last year, you said Puerto Rico was one of the ""most corrupt places on Earth"".
 Q.  The President. Well, that's true. That's true. They have been.
 The President. Q. You talked about how Congress had sent too much money.
 Q.  The President. Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], the——
 The President. Q. But you said, ""Never again."" You said Congress gave too much money to Puerto Rico. Why now are you——
 Q.  The President. Because we're building that up as a great medical pharmaceutical manufacturing area where, you know, we're going to be taking back a lot of the business that we let go for years. And we're bringing—we're going to bring it back. They were very good at it. They did a fantastic job, but they destroyed it with their tax policy. They made it impossible for people to stay, so people went to China, mostly, and to other countries. Puerto Rico has been very corrupt in terms of its politicians. You see that. They're one after another. It's been unbelievably corrupt, and we're studying that and working on that. And we think we have a good group of people who are working very well with the politicians right now.
 The President. But I think more exciting than the dollars—and you have to do something with respect to their grid; their grid is a disaster, their generators are wiped out. And they've been wiped out for years, long before Maria came. They've been wiped out for years. So if we can build Puerto Rico back into a pharmaceutical manufacturing area, we're going to designate it as such. I think it will be unbelievable for Puerto Rico, unbelievable for the people of Puerto Rico, and we can make it very successful.
 China/Antifa Movement/National Economy 
 China/Antifa Movement/National Economy  Q. And a larger question on the vaccine and on other issues regarding the experts in your Government. Last night you criticized what Christopher Wray told Congress—your FBI Director. You obviously said that the CDC Director was flat wrong on a couple of things this week. How is it that you don't trust your own experts? Do you think you know better than they do? Do you——
 Q.  The President. Oh, I do. Not at all of them, no. I think—I think I have—yes, in many cases, I do.
 The President. I think we have a bigger problem with China than we have with Russia. I think China is a far bigger problem. And I said, ""Well, that's okay if you want to think about Russia, but what about China?"" I think that's appropriate.
 I thought that the definition of Antifa was an absolutely incorrect definition, so I speak up. I like to speak up. I have fantastic people. That's why we're able to make these great trade deals; that's why we're able to do things like we're doing today; that's why the country has done so well.
 The country has done numbers like nobody had we not had the China plague come in, if that virus didn't come in—""the plague,"" I call it—if the plague from China didn't come in, the numbers we had were not only record setting, they were beyond anything anyone has ever seen in any country, frankly.
 Now, we closed it up, and now we're opening it up. And by the way, the Democrats ought to open up their States and they ought them up fast, Jon. The faster, the better, because they're hurting their people. A lot of damage done with these extended shutdowns. But we saved millions of lives by doing it the way we did it. And now we're opening it up, and you see the kind of numbers—the manufacturing numbers; you see the retail numbers; you look at the employment numbers. They're setting records. It's an incredible thing that's happening.
 Had the plague not come in, we would have been right now at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody has ever seen. But even before, it was at the highest stock market, best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We were up to 160 million people—just short of 160 million—people employed. We were never close to a number like that, and now we're doing it again. And next year, we will have a great economic year. I think one of our best.
 Yes, please. Go ahead, please.
 Q. Mr. President, what about what Wray said about White supremacists? Did you——
 Q.  United States Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies 
 United States Postal Service/Vote-by-Mail Policies  Q. The Postal Service had planned on sending 650 million facemasks to Americans back in April. That never happened. Why not? And was it because you were——
 Q.  The President. I don't know. I don't run it, to be honest.
 The President. Q. Were you running——
 Q.  The President. That's run—as you know, that's run by a Commission, and they run it. I think, frankly, if they would raise the price of packaging, you'd end up making a lot of money, or breaking even, or doing something.
 The President. The Post Office has been a mess for many, many generations, but for certainly decades. And it loses a lot of money. It's always lost a lot of money. And one of the reasons it loses a lot of money now is that it's delivering all these packages. And every time they deliver a package, they lose $3 a package or whatever the number may be.
 So I would suggest that they raise the price of packages. And you might get something where it loses very little, or maybe broke even, or maybe even made some money. Would—can you imagine a thing like that? And whether it's Amazon or any of the other internet delivery services, if you did that, you'd have a whole different Post Office. So hopefully, they'll be doing that.
 In the meantime, I know so many people in the Postal System, and I've known them over the years. They're incredible people. And they're very secure. They're going to be very secure.
 You know, the problem they have with the ballots—not the Post Office—the problem they have with the ballots is the people sending the ballots and the people counting the ballots. And who are they sending them to? Where are they being sent? Are they being sent to the wrong areas? Are they not being sent at all?
 There'll be tremendous corruption if they don't do something about it. Now, one big hope is that we're in front of numerous Federal judges in Nevada. We're in front in Pennsylvania, as you know. We're in front in Michigan. We have numerous court cases out there that are very well advanced, and you'll start seeing decisions. Just like we won the case on opening up Pennsylvania. That was a great decision by a judge that came down 2 days ago, and that was a very important decision.
 So—but we have a lot of very important decisions coming down on this, on the scam of unsolicited ballots, where they're sending out tens of millions of ballots to everybody—people that didn't expect them. People are getting inundated with ballots—they'll be showered with ballots.
 Everybody in this room knows it's a scam. Okay? Everybody in this room, even Jon. Don't say it, Jon, because——
 Q. What's a scam? What's a scam?
 Q.  The President. It's a scam.
 The President. Q. What——
 Q.  The President. Sending ballots—sending ballots——
 The President. Q. Voting by mail is a scam?
 Q.  The President. ——at a level—they are never going to be able to count them. Let me ask you——
 The President.  Vote-by-Mail Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election/2020 Presidential Election 
 Vote-by-Mail Policies/New York Democratic Primary Election/2020 Presidential Election  Q. Don't your officials vote by mail, sir? People in the White House vote by mail. Are they part of the scam?
 Q.  The President. They do, but that's different. That's called ""solicited."" When you solicit, when you go out—it's called ""absentee"" or ""solicit."" When you go out and you request a ballot—you want to say, ""I want to vote because I can't be in Florida or I can't be someplace."" You request. So you're sending something in, it's handled professionally, they send it back—it's a whole thing. That's much different than ""unsolicited,"" when you get millions of ballots. I heard numbers like 80 million ballots.
 The President. Now, just this week, they had another one—another one of the disasters that took place—an election. But look at what happened in New Jersey. And they had another one in New Jersey—very, very bad—different than Paterson. Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn—your Congressman—Murphy.
 Q. Maloney.
 Q.  The President. Maloney.
 The President. Q. Maloney.
 Q.  The President. Carolyn Maloney. Look at that. I mean, look at that race. Carolyn Maloney had a race; it was a disaster. Ballots are missing; ballots are fraud.
 The President. These are small races. These are—look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened at various other parts of the country, even over the last short period of a while. And these aren't 80 million or 50 million or 20 million votes; these are small elections. These are congressional elections where, in theory, it's easy.
 So what's going to happen on November 3 when somebody is leading and they say, ""Well, look, we haven't counted the ballots; we have millions of ballots to count""? It's a disaster. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it's a disaster. And I don't expect people here to say—although some people will. Some people would say it. Everyone knows. You don't even have to know politics to know.
 And this has nothing to do with Post Office, by the way. Where are these ballots going? Who's sending them? Who's signing them?
 You have—in Nevada, you have a Governor that signs something where he doesn't even want verification of the signature. So what does that mean? So he doesn't even want verification of the signature.
 So I think it's going to be a terrible time for this country. And we're counting on Federal judges to do a great constitutional job when they are—they're right now analyzing it—many, many Federal judges—many, like, I think five or six—but many Federal judges.
 I can tell you, in Pennsylvania, big; in Nevada, very big. I believe it's in front of a judge in Michigan. We have—a lot of judges have not yet ruled on this. But if it's ruled in a different manner or it's ruled where these millions and millions of unsolicited—people that aren't even asking. There's such a difference. You write in, you ask, they send it to you, you sign it, you send it back—that's perfect. That's ""absentee.""
 There's nothing like going to the voter booth, by the way—nothing—where they check you as you go in. There's nothing like that. But that's absentee; that's okay.
 But this scam of sending millions and millions of ballots—and you know who knows this better than I do? The Democrats. They know it's going to be a mess. They know it's going—there are going to be millions of missing ballot or tremendous numbers of missing ballots.
 You could be talking about large percentages of these ballots are going to be missing. There's going to be fraud. It's a disaster.
 Q. So let me follow up on that, sir.
 Q.  The President. And everybody—and it'd be a lot easier for me not to bring it up. But everybody knows I'm right. And you don't have to know a lot about elections. You don't have to know a lot about politics. This is going to be the scam of all time.
 The President. And hopefully, the Federal judges—all respected, all highly respected—hopefully, they'll be able to see this clearly and stop it.
 The President. Okay, thank you very much, everybody.
 The President. Q. Mr. President, I have a vaccine question. Mr. President, if you win——
 Q. The President. So I want to congratulate Puerto Rico.
 The President Q. Let me ask you this——
 Q. The President. And I think you're going to have a great period of time. I think you're going to see a rebuilding of Puerto Rico.
 The President.  Thank you very much. Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1263"
"31","The President's News Conference","
          Sep 23, 2020        ","The President. Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today Johnson and Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials. This is record time. This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial. So we have four candidates already at a very late date. ""Late"" being a very positive word, in this case.
 The President. Earlier this year, Johnson and Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September. But due to our support under Operation Warp Speed, and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they've reached phase three trials by September, far ahead of schedule. We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial. It's not only interesting, it will be a terrific thing for our country. We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can.
 Today my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 States to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents, and we want to do that the instant it is approved, not the following day, but the following moment. And so we're going to be doing that, and we'll be distributing, getting it ready, because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out.
 Through Operation Warp Speed, we also continue to accelerate lifesaving therapies. We're seeing promising results that our monoclonal antibody treatments—which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly—we're finding can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70 percent.
 By cutting the redtape and unleashing America's medical genius, we've reduced the fatality rate 85 percent since April. For individuals under 50, they have a 99.98-percent rate of survival from the China virus. And that's a number that's been really increasing substantially with time.
 As children go back to school, we're encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread. Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 States and found that only 0.076 percent of students had confirmed cases of the virus—that's a tiny percentage—and only 0.15 percent of teachers had confirmed cases.
 Patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6 percent of all emergency room visits, the lowest since the pandemic began—1.6 percent emergency room visits.
 As far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes. Everybody, including our Governors—we have Governors who are working very closely with the Task Force and with the Vice President and everybody involved. We've sent rapid-testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country.
 This week, we're sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure they can test staff regularly. And the staff now is being tested on a very, very powerful and on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level, and the best tests.
 We're encouraged that the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50 percent compared to last year. It's substantially up. The flu, when it's mixed with COVID, or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens. But that can drive numbers. And we just don't know what that will be yet, but you'll have flu numbers, and you'll have some COVID numbers.
 I think we're rounding the turn very much. You see what's happening in Europe, however. They have a very big spike. Countries that we thought were doing well aren't doing well. They had some very big spikes. Very—a very big surge.
 Months ago, we increased our Nation's procurement of the flu vaccine by 66 percent, and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible. It's possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus, and people can think it's the virus when actually it's another flu season coming on. I don't know, it's—I hope they can keep them separate. Can they keep them separate?
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. We hope so.
 White House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas The President. Huh? I doubt they will. [Laughter] It's going to be a very interesting time.
 The President. Laughter But we have a flu season coming up. We've had some flu seasons, which are really massive over the years—over many years. And we have some that are much less so. But it's still significant, so I hope they can separate them, because it's pretty close.
 In the past 4 months, we've created 10.6 million jobs. We cut unemployment rate nearly in half. The unemployment rate is cut nearly in half. Larry Kudlow is here. He'll be discussing that in a little while. Retail sales are up 121 percent; that's far above what we thought. Manufacturing is up 61 percent; that's above—also above our schedule, and our schedule is a heavy schedule. Automobile production is up six-fold. Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level in history. That's an amazing statement, Larry, the highest level in history. That means people are thinking good thoughts.
 Home sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years. Small-business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration, substantially higher. Small-business optimism—higher than at any time over the last—more than the last administration.
 Today I was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first-ever Pledge to America's Workers Presidential Award. This award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving Americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living. They're great people. Over 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the American worker, and it's really been amazing.
 We've created the fastest economic recovery in American history. You are witnessing it. You are a part of it. Our approach is proscience. Biden's approach is antiscience. If you look, it's—I don't think they know what their approach is, although a lot of it's copied from what we've done.
 Biden opposed the China travel ban and the Europe travel ban. And the strategy that they have was just never-ending lockdowns. We're not locking down. We're actually growing at a rate that we've never experienced before. But they're talking about—if you have a question, just lock it down. We're not doing that, and you can't do that.
 Our plan will crush the virus. And actually, Biden's plan will crush America, if you think about it. You can't lock down. Again, we're growing at levels that nobody has ever seen before. Our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery. Our opponent's plan would hurt America very badly. It would send us into a depression.
 And with all of that being said, we are going to be having a very exciting Saturday at 5 o'clock in the Rose Garden, where I'll be putting forth my nominee for Supreme Court Justice. And I think it will be a great nominee, a brilliant nominee. As you know, it's a woman. We brought it down to five women. It's time for a woman to be chosen, with everything that's happened and with Justice Ginsburg's passing.
 We are going to go sometime tomorrow morning, as I understand it, to pay our respects. And we'll be over there, and I guess they probably put that announcement out. But that will be done tomorrow morning. The Vice President was there today.
 And so, if you have any questions, we'll take a few questions.
 Yes. Please go ahead. Please.
 2020 Presidential Election/Vote-by-Mail Policies 
 2020 Presidential Election/Vote-by-Mail Policies  Q. Mr. President, real quickly: Win, lose, or draw in this election, will you commit here, today, for a peaceful transferal of power after the election? And there has been rioting in Louisville. There's been rioting in many cities across this country—red and—your so-called red and blue States. Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power after the election?
 Q.  The President. Well, we're going to have to see what happens. You know that. I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. And—and——
 The President. Q. I understand that, but people are rioting. Do you commit to making sure that——
 Q.  The President. Oh, I know. I know. Yes, no, we want——
 The President. Q. ——there's a peaceful transferal of power?
 Q.  The President. We want to have—get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very transfer—we'll have a very peaceful—there won't be a transfer, frankly; there'll be a continuation.
 The President. The ballots are out of control. You know it. And you know who knows it better than——
 Q. No, sir. I don't know that.
 Q.  The President. ——anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.
 The President.  Go ahead.
 Q. No, sir. Mr. President, the second question is, will you also——
 Q.  Q. Thank you. Will you——
 Q.  The President. Please, go ahead. Please, go ahead.
 The President. Q. Why won't you commit—why won't you——
 Q.  The President. You asked a question.
 The President. Go ahead, please.
 Q. Mr. President, why won't you——
 Q.  Q. Mr. President, do you plan to——
 Q.  The President. Say it.
 The President Supreme Court Nomination Process 
 Supreme Court Nomination Process  Q. Mr. President, do you plan to meet with Barbara Lagoa at the White House?
 Q.  The President. Can you—I cannot hear you through your mask.
 The President. Q. I'm sorry. Do you plan to meet with Barbara Lagoa in Washington? And is she still on your shortlist?
 Q.  The President. She is on my list. I don't have a meeting planned, but she is on my list.
 The President. Q. Do you—do you have a——
 Q.  The President. But I don't really talk about the meetings planned. I— speak to people. I talk to people. But I don't have a meeting planned. No.
 The President. Q. Do you have a response to the Governor of Missouri testing positive for coronavirus?
 Q.  The President. I didn't know that. No.
 The President. Yes, John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.
 Kentucky Grand Jury Decision on the Police-Involved Death of Breonna Taylor/Protests in Louisville, Kentucky 
 Kentucky Grand Jury Decision on the Police-Involved Death of Breonna Taylor/Protests in Louisville, Kentucky  Q. Mr. President, we asked you earlier today about the Breonna Taylor case.
 Q.  The President. Yes.
 The President Q. Could you comment now? I assume you've been briefed on the——
 Q.  The President. I have.
 The President Q. ——charges in the Breonna Taylor case?
 Q.  The President. Well, I thought it was really brilliant. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is doing a fantastic job, I think he's a star. And he made a statement that I'll just read: ""Justice is not often easy. It does not fit the mold of public opinion and it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice—it just becomes revenge.""
 The President. I mean, I heard that, I said, ""Write that down for me, please."" Because I think it's—it was a terrific statement. He's handling it very well. You know who he is, right? You—I think you know. I think everyone now knows who he is.
 I will be speaking to the Governor. And we have a call scheduled to make very shortly with the Governor. I understand he's called up the National Guard, which is a good thing. I think it's a very positive thing. And it will all work out.
 Q. Mr. President, on that——
 Q. Supreme Court Nomination Process 
 Supreme Court Nomination Process  Q. And could I—can I just—following on your Supreme Court nominee? It's highly unlikely that any Democrats will vote for your nominee if and when it comes to a vote in the Senate.
 Q.  The President. Well, we don't know that. I mean——
 The President. Q. Given the—well, given the——
 Q.  The President. ——it's an awfully good——
 The President. —— Q. Given the posture, I think——
 Q.  The President. ——awfully good candidate.
 The President.  Q. ——that's a pretty safe assumption. But, on that point, would you want to nominate someone who, in their confirmation to the appellate court, received broad bipartisan support? Or would you be more inclined to put forward somebody whose confirmation fell along party lines? The President. I can't tell you what's going to happen with the Democrats. I can say this: The person that I will be putting up—and I won't say that I've even chosen that person yet; I could say any one of the five. They're outstanding women.
 Q.  The President. But the person I'll be putting up is highly qualified, totally brilliant, top-of-the-line academic student, the highest credentials. All of them have that, but the highest credentials. And you'll see on Saturday who that is.
 I can't imagine why a Democrat wouldn't vote for this person, but you may be right.
 Q. Mr. President, to follow——
 Q. The President. Frankly, I'd bet on you.
 The President.  Q. Mr. President——
 Q. The President. I'd probably bet on you.
 The President. Yes, please, go ahead.
 Q. Thank you very much.
 Q.  The President. No, I didn't—not you. Right here.
 The President. Q. Okay.
 Q.  Duchess Meghan Markle of Sussex and Prince Harry of the United Kingdom 
 Duchess Meghan Markle of Sussex and Prince Harry of the United Kingdom  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle chimed in on the U.S. election and essentially encouraged people to vote for Joe Biden. I wanted to get your reaction to that.
 Q.  The President. I'm not a fan of hers. [Laughter] And I would say this—and she has probably has heard that—but, I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's going to need it. [Laughter]
 The President. Laughter Laughter Yes, please. Go ahead.
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. Mr. President, the FDA is reportedly considering stricter guidelines for the emergency authorization of a COVID vaccine. Are you okay with that?
 Q.  The President. Well, I'll tell you what, we're looking at that, and that has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it. That sounds like a political move, because when you have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, these great companies coming up with these—the vaccines, and they've done testing and everything else, I'm saying, ""Why would they have to be, you know, adding great length to the process?""
 The President. We want to have people not get sick. The vaccine is very important. It's the final step. I believe it's going to be the final step. And no, we're looking at that, but I think it's—that was a political move more than anything else.
 Q. One follow-up on that, sir. It's designed to improve trust in the vaccine. Do you think that's not needed?
 Q.  The President. Well, I have tremendous trust in these massive companies that are so brilliantly organized, in terms of what they've been doing with the tests. I mean, I don't know that a government, as big as we are, could do tests like this. We've made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion.
 The President. But when they come back, and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works, and they're coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with, I don't see any reason why it should be delayed further. Because if they delay it a week or 2 weeks or 3 weeks, you know, that's a lot of lives you're talking about.
 Scott, would you agree with that or how do you feel about that? Please, Scott.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. Yes, thanks. Yes, I mean there is no—I think that people don't understand what's going on with Operation Warp Speed. It's unprecedented what's happened here.
 Pandemic Adviser Atlas. A typical vaccine takes roughly 4 years or so, and now we're going to have a vaccine—highly likely—in far less than 1 year, but without cutting any safety corners, because the President has done things concomitant to the development of the vaccine: that is, the manufacturing and the logistics. Everything is being done at the same time, and that's never been done before.
 But there is zero cutting of safety concerns. There is—there should be no hesitation about the safety. You shouldn't be punished by doing something faster than other people could have done or thought; it's the opposite. We have a pandemic. The urgency is the pandemic, not politics.
 Q. Are you amending——
 Q.  The President. It sounded to me—it sounded extremely political. Why would they do this when we come back with these great results? And I think you will have those great results, because why would we——
 The President. Coronavirus Vaccine Development 
 Coronavirus Vaccine Development  Q. Well, when do you expect this vaccine then?
 Q.  The President. Why would we be delaying it? But we're going to look at it. We're going to take a look at it. And ultimately, the White House has to approve it. And maybe we will, and maybe we won't. But we'll be taking——
 The President. Q. Mr. President——
 Q. The President. Look, I have to leave for an emergency phone call. I'm going to let Scott and Larry finish up. Larry is going to talk about the economy.

          May 18, 2020        ","Today, First Lady Melania Trump joined President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in a discussion with approximately 50 of our Nation's governors and, at the request of the First Lady, their spouses. Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., and the White House Coronavirus Task Force also joined to discuss best practices and continue the dialogue on the important partnership with our Nation's governors on COVID-19 response, recovery, and ensuring the well-being of all Americans.
 First Lady Melania Trump opened the discussion by addressing mental health, ""As we begin to safely reopen our country and adjust to new changes in our daily lives,"" said First Lady Melania Trump, ""I invite you to join the conversation about mental health and how we can partner with each of your states to support all Americans – especially children.""
 The first pillar of the First Lady's Be Best initiative is well-being. She has used this initiative to support the physical, social and emotional health of children since May of 2018. In addition, the President declared May 2020 as National Mental Health Awareness Month and has called on Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illnesses, raise awareness of mental health conditions through appropriate programs and activities, and commit our Nation to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
 COVID-19 has caused immense suffering and loss for many people. ""Whether in quarantine or on the front lines of the fight against the virus, many Americans, including children, are experiencing an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness, isolation and fear"" said First Lady Melania Trump. ""Children need the support of healthy, caring adults who can help them understand the changes in the world around them as we begin to safely reopen our country.""
 The First Lady went on to discuss the increase in resources the Trump Administration has provided to support mental health and well-being and how we must also protect children from the deadly effects of opioid addiction and overdose, the second pillar of her Be Best initiative, by ensuring adults have the support they need during these unprecedented times.
 The First Lady's remarks concluded with a call-to-action. ""I ask you all to designate child welfare staff as first responders so that these critical workers have access to Personal Protective Equipment when face-to-face intervention is needed to protect a child's physical health during the coronavirus pandemic."" COVID-19 has created serious challenges for child welfare agencies charged with ensuring the physical safety and well-being of children around the country. Now more than ever, there is a critical need for all children, including those in foster care, to have safe, stable homes. The First Lady and the Trump Administration have made child welfare a priority by providing guidance and best practices for remote or virtual court hearings in child welfare cases and supporting caseworkers by allowing videoconferencing for monthly visits.
 In addition to the President, First Lady, and Vice President, Governors heard from White House Coronavirus Coordinator Dr. Birx, who provided an update on States expanding their entire testing ecosystem, including testing in nursing homes. Dr. Tony Fauci provided an overview of vaccine development through Project Warp Speed and additional Remdesivir distribution, and HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Dr. Ellie McCance-Katz shared a critical perspective about the negative effects that quarantine and social isolation can have on mental health.

"33","Press Release - Readout from the State and Local Stakeholder Call on COVID-19 Response","
          May 20, 2020        ","Today, First Lady Melania Trump joined a call with approximately 3,000 state, local, and tribal officials, along with Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and other federal officials, to continue the dialogue on the Administration's response to COVID-19. Discussion topics included implementation of the CARES Act, updates from the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and updates about other federal policies affected by COVID-19.
 This conversation followed a call that the First Lady had with our nation's Governors earlier in the week with the President and Vice President, which addressed the toll and emotional hardship that the virus has caused for our nation's citizens and children.
 First Lady Melania Trump opened today's call by highlighting the need for supporting our most vulnerable and families with necessary mental health resources needed to ensure the physical safety and well-being of children around the nation.
 The First Lady's Be Best initiative has taken an active role in addressing the impact COVID-19 has on children and families. Be Best has highlighted countless well-being programs that provide children with the tools and skills required for emotional, social, and physical health.
 During this difficult time, Be Best has also recognized the effects coronavirus has on those suffering from substance abuse. ""We can protect children from the deadly effects of opioid addiction and overdose by helping the adults in their lives get the support they need without turning to drugs or suicide,"" said First Lady Melania Trump.
 The First Lady went on to discuss the increase in resources the Trump Administration has provided to support mental health. ""Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the rest of HHS have worked around the clock to release approximately $700 million over the last few months to provide communities with resources to expand and develop mental health programs. These programs range from suicide prevention to substance use disorders to serious mental illness.""
 The First Lady's remarks concluded by providing encouragement and support to the State and local officials, telling them that ""your voices are powerful, and your actions can give courage to people who are struggling. I hope we can all continue the conversation about mental health and well-being, and make it as much of a priority as physical health and safety.""
 First Lady Melania Trump's Full Remarks
 First Lady Melania Trump's Full Remarks Good afternoon,
 As we begin to safely re-open our country and adjust to new changes in our daily lives, I invite you to join the conversation about mental health and how we can partner with each of your states to support all Americans – especially children.
 One of the three pillars of my BE BEST initiative is ""well-being,"" which focuses on children's emotional, social, and physical health.
 Whether in quarantine or on the front lines of the fight against the virus, many Americans – including children – are experiencing an increase in anxiety, depression, loneliness, isolation, and fear.
 This Administration has increased resources to support mental health and well-being, which I shared with the nation's Governors this past Monday.
 SAMHSA and the rest of HHS have worked around the clock to release approximately $700 million over the last few months to provide communities with resources to expand and develop mental health programs. These programs range from suicide prevention to substance use disorders to serious mental illness.
 I encourage you to make use of these resources – and work with us to remove any stigma around these issues by continuing the conversation in your communities.
 In addition, we can help protect children from the deadly effects of opioid addiction and overdose by helping the adults in their lives get the support they need without turning to drugs or suicide. This is another priority of BE BEST, as I know it is for many of you.
 I also encourage you to make sure that children are not overlooked during this crisis.
 Right now, because of social distancing guidelines, many children do not have regular in-person contact with teachers, childcare providers, and other adults who are often the first to report suspected child abuse.
 On Monday, I asked Governors to designate child welfare staff as first responders so that these critical workers have access to Personal Protective Equipment when face-to-face intervention is needed to protect a child's physical health during the coronavirus pandemic.
 As state and local leaders, there are many ways that you can show strong leadership on mental health awareness. I ask that you look for opportunities to educate the members of your communities about mental health issues, and support people with mental illnesses through community and support groups.
 I encourage you to connect people in your communities to help, and strengthen the connections between mental health, substance abuse, disability, and other social services.
 Your voices are powerful, and your actions can give courage to people who are struggling. I hope we can all continue the conversation about mental health and wellbeing, and make it as much of a priority as physical health and safety.
 Together, we need to make sure that America's most fragile – our children – are not overlooked during this crisis, and that they are both seen and heard by caring adults who can help them thrive.
 Thank you.","https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-release-readout-from-the-state-and-local-stakeholder-call-covid-19-response"
